The origin is deeply rooted in our journey from\\ndata science into data engineering. We often jokingly refer to ourselves as recovering\\ndata scientists. We both had the experience of being assigned to data science projects,\\nthen struggling to execute these projects due to a lack of proper foundations. Our\\njourney into data engineering began when we undertook data engineering tasks to\\nbuild foundations and infrastructure.\\nWith the rise of data science, companies splashed out lavishly on data science talent,\\nhoping to reap rich rewards. Very often, data scientists struggled with basic problems\\nthat their background and training did not address—data collection, data cleansing,\\ndata access, data transformation, and data infrastructure. These are problems that\\ndata engineering aims to solve.\\nWhat This Book Isn’t\\nBefore we cover what this book is about and what you’ll get out of it, let’s quickly\\ncover what this book isn’t. This book isn’t about data engineering using a particular\\ntool, technology, or platform. While many excellent books approach data engineering\\ntechnologies from this perspective, these books have a short shelf life. Instead, we\\nfocus on the fundamental concepts behind data engineering.\\nWhat This Book Is About\\nThis book aims to fill a gap in current data engineering content and materials.\\nWhile there’s no shortage of technical resources that address specific data engineering\\ntools and technologies, people struggle to understand how to assemble these compo‐\\nnents into a coherent whole that applies in the real world. This book connects the\\ndots of the end-to-end data lifecycle. It shows you how to stitch together various\\ntechnologies to serve the needs of downstream data consumers such as analysts,\\ndata scientists, and machine learning engineers. This book works as a complement\\nxiii'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 18, 'page_label': 'xiii'}, page_content='to O’Reilly books that cover the details of particular technologies, platforms, and\\nprogramming languages.\\nThe big idea of this book is the data engineering lifecycle : data generation, storage,\\ningestion, transformation, and serving. Since the dawn of data, we’ve seen the rise\\nand fall of innumerable specific technologies and vendor products, but the data engi‐\\nneering lifecycle stages have remained essentially unchanged. With this framework,\\nthe reader will come away with a sound understanding for applying technologies to\\nreal-world business problems.\\nOur goal here is to map out principles that reach across two axes. First, we wish to\\ndistill data engineering into principles that can encompass any relevant technology .\\nSecond, we wish to present principles that will stand the test of time. We hope that\\nthese ideas reflect lessons learned across the data technology upheaval of the last\\ntwenty years and that our mental framework will remain useful for a decade or more\\ninto the future.\\nOne thing to note: we unapologetically take a cloud-first approach. We view the\\ncloud as a fundamentally transformative development that will endure for decades;\\nmost on-premises data systems and workloads will eventually move to cloud hosting.\\nWe assume that infrastructure and systems are ephemeral and scalable, and that data\\nengineers will lean toward deploying managed services in the cloud. That said, most\\nconcepts in this book will translate to non-cloud environments.\\nWho Should Read This Book\\nOur primary intended audience for this book consists of technical practitioners, mid-\\nto senior-level software engineers, data scientists, or analysts interested in moving\\ninto data engineering; or data engineers working in the guts of specific technologies,\\nbut wanting to develop a more comprehensive perspective. Our secondary target\\naudience consists of data stakeholders who work adjacent to technical practition‐\\ners—e.g., a data team lead with a technical background overseeing a team of data\\nengineers, or a director of data warehousing wanting to migrate from on-premises\\ntechnology to a cloud-based solution.\\nIdeally, you’re curious and want to learn—why else would you be reading this book?\\nY ou stay current with data technologies and trends by reading books and articles on\\ndata warehousing/data lakes, batch and streaming systems, orchestration, modeling,\\nmanagement, analysis, developments in cloud technologies, etc. This book will help\\nyou weave what you’ve read into a complete picture of data engineering across\\ntechnologies and paradigms.\\nxiv | Preface'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 19, 'page_label': 'xiv'}, page_content='Prerequisites\\nWe assume a good deal of familiarity with the types of data systems found in a\\ncorporate setting.

This section is not a history lesson, but looking at the past is invaluable\\nin understanding where we are today and where things are going. A common theme\\nconstantly reappears: what’s old is new again.\\nThe early days: 1980 to 2000, from data warehousing to the web\\nThe birth of the data engineer arguably has its roots in data warehousing, dating as\\nfar back as the 1970s, with the business data warehouse  taking shape in the 1980s\\nand Bill Inmon officially coining the term data warehouse in 1989. After engineers\\nat IBM developed the relational database and Structured Query Language (SQL),\\nOracle popularized the technology. As nascent data systems grew, businesses needed\\ndedicated tools and data pipelines for reporting and business intelligence (BI). To\\nhelp people correctly model their business logic in the data warehouse, Ralph Kimball\\nand Inmon developed their respective eponymous data-modeling techniques and\\napproaches, which are still widely used today.\\nData warehousing ushered in the first age of scalable analytics, with new massively\\nparallel processing (MPP) databases that use multiple processors to crunch large\\namounts of data coming on the market and supporting unprecedented volumes\\nof data. Roles such as BI engineer, ETL developer, and data warehouse engineer\\naddressed the various needs of the data warehouse. Data warehouse and BI engineer‐\\ning were a precursor to today’s data engineering and still play a central role in the\\ndiscipline.\\nThe internet went mainstream around the mid-1990s, creating a whole new genera‐\\ntion of web-first companies such as AOL, Y ahoo, and Amazon. The dot-com boom\\nspawned a ton of activity in web applications and the backend systems to support\\nthem—servers, databases, and storage. Much of the infrastructure was expensive,\\nmonolithic, and heavily licensed. The vendors selling these backend systems likely\\ndidn’t foresee the sheer scale of the data that web applications would produce.\\nThe early 2000s: The birth of contemporary data engineering\\nFast-forward to the early 2000s, when the dot-com boom of the late ’90s went bust,\\nleaving behind a tiny cluster of survivors.

Utilize custom-built technology only where it provides a\\ncompetitive advantage.\\nThe Background and Skills of a Data Engineer\\nData engineering is a fast-growing field, and a lot of questions remain about how\\nto become a data engineer. Because data engineering is a relatively new discipline,\\nlittle formal training is available to enter the field. Universities don’t have a standard\\ndata engineering path. Although a handful of data engineering boot camps and online\\ntutorials cover random topics, a common curriculum for the subject doesn’t yet exist.\\nPeople entering data engineering arrive with varying backgrounds in education,\\ncareer, and skill set. Everyone entering the field should expect to invest a significant\\namount of time in self-study. Reading this book is a good starting point; one of the\\nprimary goals of this book is to give you a foundation for the knowledge and skills we\\nthink are necessary to succeed as a data engineer.\\nIf you’re pivoting your career into data engineering, we’ve found that the transition is\\neasiest when moving from an adjacent field, such as software engineering, ETL devel‐\\nopment, database administration, data science, or data analysis. These disciplines\\ntend to be “data aware” and provide good context for data roles in an organization.\\nThey also equip folks with the relevant technical skills and context to solve data\\nengineering problems.\\nDespite the lack of a formalized path, a requisite body of knowledge exists that we\\nbelieve a data engineer should know to be successful. By definition, a data engineer\\nmust understand both data and technology. With respect to data, this entails knowing\\nabout various best practices around data management. On the technology end, a\\ndata engineer must be aware of various options for tools, their interplay, and their\\ntrade-offs. This requires a good understanding of software engineering, DataOps, and\\ndata architecture.\\nData Engineering Skills and Activities | 17'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 42, 'page_label': '17'}, page_content='Zooming out, a data engineer must also understand the requirements of data con‐\\nsumers (data analysts and data scientists) and the broader implications of data across\\nthe organization.

ML engineers often have\\nadvanced working knowledge of ML and deep learning techniques and frameworks\\nsuch as PyTorch or TensorFlow.\\nML engineers also understand the hardware, services, and systems required to run\\nthese frameworks, both for model training and model deployment at a production\\nscale. It’s common for ML flows to run in a cloud environment where ML engineers\\ncan spin up and scale infrastructure resources on demand or rely on managed\\nservices.\\nAs we’ve mentioned, the boundaries between ML engineering, data engineering, and\\ndata science are blurry. Data engineers may have some operational responsibilities\\nover ML systems, and data scientists may work closely with ML engineering in\\ndesigning advanced ML processes.\\nData Engineers Inside an Organization | 27'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 52, 'page_label': '27'}, page_content='The world of ML engineering is snowballing and parallels a lot of the same develop‐\\nments occurring in data engineering.

A chief information officer (CIO) is the senior C-suite\\nexecutive responsible for information technology within an organization; it is an\\ninternal-facing role. A CIO must possess deep knowledge of information technology\\nand business processes—either alone is insufficient. CIOs direct the information\\ntechnology organization, setting ongoing policies while also defining and executing\\nsignificant initiatives under the direction of the CEO.\\nCIOs often collaborate with data engineering leadership in organizations with a well-\\ndeveloped data culture. If an organization is not very high in its data maturity, a CIO\\nwill typically help shape its data culture. CIOs will work with engineers and architects\\nto map out major initiatives and make strategic decisions on adopting major architec‐\\ntural elements, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship\\nmanagement (CRM) systems, cloud migrations, data systems, and internal-facing IT.\\nChief technology officer.    A chief technology officer (CTO) is similar to a CIO but faces\\noutward. A CTO owns the key technological strategy and architectures for external-\\nfacing applications, such as mobile, web apps, and IoT—all critical data sources for\\ndata engineers. The CTO is likely a skilled technologist and has a good sense of\\nsoftware engineering fundamentals and system architecture. In some organizations\\nwithout a CIO, the CTO or sometimes the chief operating officer (COO) plays the\\nrole of CIO. Data engineers often report directly or indirectly through a CTO.\\nChief data officer.    The chief data officer (CDO) was created in 2002 at Capital One\\nto recognize the growing importance of data as a business asset. The CDO is respon‐\\nsible for a company’s data assets and strategy. CDOs are focused on data’s business\\nutility but should have a strong technical grounding. CDOs oversee data products,\\nstrategy, initiatives, and core functions such as master data management and privacy.\\nOccasionally, CDOs manage business analytics and data engineering.\\nChief analytics officer.    The chief analytics officer (CAO) is a variant of the CDO\\nrole. Where both roles exist, the CDO focuses on the technology and organization\\nrequired to deliver data.

Business never sleeps, and business stakehold‐\\ners often have a significant backlog of things they want to address and new initiatives\\nthey want to launch. Project managers must filter a long list of requests and prioritize\\ncritical deliverables to keep projects on track and better serve the company.\\nData engineers interact with project managers, often planning sprints for projects\\nand ensuing standups related to the sprint.

This chapter introduces the major stages of the data engineering lifecycle,\\nfocusing on each stage’s core concepts and saving details for later chapters.\\nWe divide the data engineering lifecycle into five stages (Figure 2-1, top):\\n• Generation•\\n• Storage•\\n• Ingestion•\\n• Transformation•\\n• Serving data•\\n33'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 58, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='Figure 2-1.

Next, we transform the data and then proceed to our central goal, serving\\ndata to analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, and others. In reality, storage occurs\\nthroughout the lifecycle as data flows from beginning to end—hence, the diagram\\nshows the storage “stage” as a foundation that underpins other stages.\\nIn general, the middle stages—storage, ingestion, transformation—can get a bit jum‐\\nbled. And that’s OK. Although we split out the distinct parts of the data engineering\\nlifecycle, it’s not always a neat, continuous flow. Various stages of the lifecycle may\\nrepeat themselves, occur out of order, overlap, or weave together in interesting and\\nunexpected ways.\\nActing as a bedrock are undercurrents (Figure 2-1, bottom) that cut across multiple\\nstages of the data engineering lifecycle: security, data management, DataOps, data\\narchitecture, orchestration, and software engineering. No part of the data engineering\\nlifecycle can adequately function without these undercurrents.\\nThe Data Lifecycle Versus the Data Engineering Lifecycle\\nY ou may be wondering about the difference between the overall data lifecycle and\\nthe data engineering lifecycle. There’s a subtle distinction between the two. The data\\nengineering lifecycle is a subset of the whole data lifecycle ( Figure 2-2).

A data engineer consumes data from a source system but\\ndoesn’t typically own or control the source system itself.

For\\nexample, will analytical queries against a source application database cause resource\\ncontention and performance issues?\\nOne of the most challenging nuances of source data is the schema. The schema\\ndefines the hierarchical organization of data. Logically, we can think of data at the\\nlevel of a whole source system, drilling down into individual tables, all the way to\\nthe structure of respective fields. The schema of data shipped from source systems is\\nhandled in various ways. Two popular options are schemaless and fixed schema.\\nSchemaless doesn’t mean the absence of schema. Rather, it means that the application\\ndefines the schema as data is written, whether to a message queue, a flat file, a blob, or\\na document database such as MongoDB. A more traditional model built on relational\\ndatabase storage uses a fixed schema enforced in the database, to which application\\nwrites must conform.\\nEither of these models presents challenges for data engineers. Schemas change over\\ntime; in fact, schema evolution is encouraged in the Agile approach to software\\ndevelopment. A key part of the data engineer’s job is taking raw data input in the\\nsource system schema and transforming this into valuable output for analytics. This\\njob becomes more challenging as the source schema evolves.\\nWe dive into source systems in greater detail in Chapter 5; we also cover schemas and\\ndata modeling in Chapters 6 and 8, respectively.\\nWhat Is the Data Engineering Lifecycle? | 37'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 62, 'page_label': '37'}, page_content='Storage\\nY ou need a place to store data.

For example, cloud\\ndata warehouses can store data, process data in pipelines, and serve it to analysts.\\nStreaming frameworks such as Apache Kafka and Pulsar can function simultaneously\\nas ingestion, storage, and query systems for messages, with object storage being a\\nstandard layer for data transmission.\\nEvaluating storage systems: Key engineering considerations\\nHere are a few key engineering questions to ask when choosing a storage system for a\\ndata warehouse, data lakehouse, database, or object storage:\\n• Is this storage solution compatible with the architecture’s required write and read•\\nspeeds?\\n• Will storage create a bottleneck for downstream processes?•\\n• Do you understand how this storage technology works? Are you utilizing the•\\nstorage system optimally or committing unnatural acts? For instance, are you\\napplying a high rate of random access updates in an object storage system? (This\\nis an antipattern with significant performance overhead.)\\n• Will this storage system handle anticipated future scale? Y ou should consider all•\\ncapacity limits on the storage system: total available storage, read operation rate,\\nwrite volume, etc.\\n• Will downstream users and processes be able to retrieve data in the required•\\nservice-level agreement (SLA)?\\n• Are you capturing metadata about schema evolution, data flows, data lineage,•\\nand so forth?

The\\nlatency required to qualify as real-time varies by domain and requirements.\\nBatch data is ingested either on a predetermined time interval or as data reaches a\\npreset size threshold. Batch ingestion is a one-way door: once data is broken into\\nbatches, the latency for downstream consumers is inherently constrained. Because of\\nlimitations of legacy systems, batch was for a long time the default way to ingest data.\\nBatch processing remains an extremely popular way to ingest data for downstream\\nconsumption, particularly in analytics and ML.\\nHowever, the separation of storage and compute in many systems and the ubiquity\\nof event-streaming and processing platforms make the continuous processing of data\\nstreams much more accessible and increasingly popular.

Many great ingestion\\nframeworks do handle both batch and micro-batch ingestion styles. We think batch\\nis an excellent approach for many common use cases, such as model training and\\nweekly reporting. Adopt true real-time streaming only after identifying a business use\\ncase that justifies the trade-offs against using batch.\\nPush versus pull\\nIn the push model of data ingestion, a source system writes data out to a target,\\nwhether a database, object store, or filesystem. In the pull model, data is retrieved\\nfrom the source system. The line between the push and pull paradigms can be quite\\nblurry; data is often pushed and pulled as it works its way through the various stages\\nof a data pipeline.\\nConsider, for example, the extract, transform, load (ETL) process, commonly used in\\nbatch-oriented ingestion workflows. ETL ’s extract (E) part clarifies that we’re dealing\\nwith a pull ingestion model. In traditional ETL, the ingestion system queries a current\\nsource table snapshot on a fixed schedule. Y ou’ll learn more about ETL and extract,\\nload, transform (ELT) throughout this book.\\nIn another example, consider continuous CDC, which is achieved in a few ways.\\nOne common method triggers a message every time a row is changed in the source\\ndatabase. This message is pushed to a queue, where the ingestion system picks it up.\\nAnother common CDC method uses binary logs, which record every commit to the\\ndatabase. The database pushes to its logs. The ingestion system reads the logs but\\ndoesn’t directly interact with the database otherwise. This adds little to no additional\\nload to the source database. Some versions of batch CDC use the pull pattern. For\\nexample, in timestamp-based CDC, an ingestion system queries the source database\\nand pulls the rows that have changed since the previous update.\\nWith streaming ingestion, data bypasses a backend database and is pushed directly\\nto an endpoint, typically with data buffered by an event-streaming platform. This\\npattern is useful with fleets of IoT sensors emitting sensor data. Rather than relying\\non a database to maintain the current state, we simply think of each recorded reading\\nas an event. This pattern is also growing in popularity in software applications as\\nit simplifies real-time processing, allows app developers to tailor their messages for\\ndownstream analytics, and greatly simplifies the lives of data engineers.\\nWe discuss ingestion best practices and techniques in depth in Chapter 7.

Typically, data is\\ntransformed in source systems or in flight during ingestion. For example, a source\\nsystem may add an event timestamp to a record before forwarding it to an ingestion\\nprocess. Or a record within a streaming pipeline may be “enriched” with additional\\nfields and calculations before it’s sent to a data warehouse.

As we mentioned earlier, business logic is often applied to data in the\\ntransformation stage of the data engineering lifecycle, but a logic-on-read approach\\nhas become increasingly popular. Data is stored in a clean but fairly raw form,\\nwith minimal postprocessing business logic. A BI system maintains a repository of\\nbusiness logic and definitions. This business logic is used to query the data warehouse\\nso that reports and dashboards align with business definitions.\\nAs a company grows its data maturity, it will move from ad hoc data analysis to\\nself-service analytics, allowing democratized data access to business users without\\nneeding IT to intervene. The capability to do self-service analytics assumes that\\ndata is good enough that people across the organization can simply access it them‐\\nselves, slice and dice it however they choose, and get immediate insights. Although\\nself-service analytics is simple in theory, it’s tough to pull off in practice. The main\\nreason is that poor data quality, organizational silos, and a lack of adequate data skills\\noften get in the way of allowing widespread use of analytics.\\nOperational analytics.    Operational analytics  focuses on the fine-grained details of\\noperations, promoting actions that a user of the reports can act upon immediately.\\nOperational analytics could be a live view of inventory or real-time dashboarding of\\nwebsite or application health. In this case, data is consumed in real time, either\\ndirectly from a source system or from a streaming data pipeline. The types of\\ninsights in operational analytics differ from traditional BI since operational analytics\\nis focused on the present and doesn’t necessarily concern historical trends.\\nEmbedded analytics.

Data engineering now encompasses\\nfar more than tools and technology. The field is now moving up the value chain,\\nincorporating traditional enterprise practices such as data management and cost\\noptimization and newer practices like DataOps.\\nWe’ve termed these practices undercurrents—security, data management, DataOps,\\ndata architecture, orchestration, and software engineering—that support every aspect\\nof the data engineering lifecycle ( Figure 2-7). In this section, we give a brief overview\\nof these undercurrents and their major components, which you’ll see in more detail\\nthroughout the book.\\nFigure 2-7. The major undercurrents of data engineering\\nSecurity\\nSecurity must be top of mind for data engineers, and those who ignore it do so\\nat their peril. That’s why security is the first undercurrent. Data engineers must\\nunderstand both data and access security, exercising the principle of least privilege.\\nThe principle of least privilege  means giving a user or system access to only the\\nessential data and resources to perform an intended function. A common antipattern\\nwe see with data engineers with little security experience is to give admin access to all\\nusers. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen!\\nGive users only the access they need to do their jobs today, nothing more. Don’t\\noperate from a root shell when you’re just looking for visible files with standard user\\naccess. When querying tables with a lesser role, don’t use the superuser role in a\\ndatabase. Imposing the principle of least privilege on ourselves can prevent accidental\\ndamage and keep you in a security-first mindset.\\nPeople and organizational structure are always the biggest security vulnerabilities in\\nany company. When we hear about major security breaches in the media, it often\\nturns out that someone in the company ignored basic precautions, fell victim to a\\nphishing attack, or otherwise acted irresponsibly. The first line of defense for data\\nsecurity is to create a culture of security that permeates the organization. All individ‐\\nuals who have access to data must understand their responsibility in protecting the\\ncompany’s sensitive data and its customers.\\nMajor Undercurrents Across the Data Engineering Lifecycle | 49'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 74, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='Data security is also about timing—providing data access to exactly the people and\\nsystems that need to access it and only for the duration necessary to perform their\\nwork.

For instance, strict normalization doesn’t work well with event\\ndata. Fortunately, a new generation of data tools increases the flexibility of data\\nmodels, while retaining logical separations of measures, dimensions, attributes, and\\nhierarchies. Cloud data warehouses support the ingestion of enormous quantities of\\ndenormalized and semistructured data, while still supporting common data modeling\\npatterns, such as Kimball, Inmon, and Data Vault. Data processing frameworks\\nsuch as Spark can ingest a whole spectrum of data, from flat structured relational\\nrecords to raw unstructured text. We discuss these data modeling and transformation\\npatterns in greater detail in Chapter 8.\\nWith the wide variety of data that engineers must cope with, there is a temptation\\nto throw up our hands and give up on data modeling.

A soft‐\\nware product provides specific functionality and technical features for end users. By\\ncontrast, a data product is built around sound business logic and metrics, whose users\\nmake decisions or build models that perform automated actions. A data engineer\\nmust understand both the technical aspects of building software products and the\\nbusiness logic, quality, and metrics that will create excellent data products.\\nLike DevOps, DataOps borrows much from lean manufacturing and supply chain\\nmanagement, mixing people, processes, and technology to reduce time to value. As\\nData Kitchen (experts in DataOps) describes it:7\\nDataOps is a collection of technical practices, workflows, cultural norms, and architec‐\\ntural patterns that enable:\\n• Rapid innovation and experimentation delivering new insights to customers with•\\nincreasing velocity\\n• Extremely high data quality and very low error rates•\\n• Collaboration across complex arrays of people, technology, and environments•\\n• Clear measurement, monitoring, and transparency of results•\\nLean practices (such as lead time reduction and minimizing defects) and the resulting\\nimprovements to quality and productivity are things we are glad to see gaining\\nmomentum both in software and data operations.\\nFirst and foremost, DataOps is a set of cultural habits; the data engineering team\\nneeds to adopt a cycle of communicating and collaborating with the business,\\nbreaking down silos, continuously learning from successes and mistakes, and rapid\\niteration. Only when these cultural habits are set in place can the team get the best\\nresults from technology and tools.\\nDepending on a company’s data maturity, a data engineer has some options to build\\nDataOps into the fabric of the overall data engineering lifecycle. If the company\\nhas no preexisting data infrastructure or practices, DataOps is very much a green‐\\nfield opportunity that can be baked in from day one. With an existing project or\\ninfrastructure that lacks DataOps, a data engineer can begin adding DataOps into\\nworkflows. We suggest first starting with observability and monitoring to get a\\nwindow into the performance of a system, then adding in automation and incident\\nresponse.

An organization with a low level of DataOps maturity often attempts to\\nschedule multiple stages of data transformation processes using cron jobs. This works\\nwell for a while. As data pipelines become more complicated, several things are likely\\nto happen. If the cron jobs are hosted on a cloud instance, the instance may have an\\noperational problem, causing the jobs to stop running unexpectedly. As the spacing\\nbetween jobs becomes tighter, a job will eventually run long, causing a subsequent job\\nto fail or produce stale data. Engineers may not be aware of job failures until they\\nhear from analysts that their reports are out-of-date.\\nAs the organization’s data maturity grows, data engineers will typically adopt an\\norchestration framework, perhaps Airflow or Dagster. Data engineers are aware that\\nAirflow presents an operational burden, but the benefits of orchestration eventually\\noutweigh the complexity. Engineers will gradually migrate their cron jobs to Airflow\\njobs. Now, dependencies are checked before jobs run. More transformation jobs can\\nbe packed into a given time because each job can start as soon as upstream data is\\nready rather than at a fixed, predetermined time.\\nThe data engineering team still has room for operational improvements. A data\\nscientist eventually deploys a broken DAG, bringing down the Airflow web server\\nand leaving the data team operationally blind. After enough such headaches, the\\ndata engineering team members realize that they need to stop allowing manual DAG\\ndeployments. In their next phase of operational maturity, they adopt automated\\nDAG deployment. DAGs are tested before deployment, and monitoring processes\\nensure that the new DAGs start running properly.

Initiatives are undermined and\\ndestroyed, years of work wasted. In some of the worst cases, bad data may lead\\ncompanies to financial ruin.\\nAnother horror story occurs when the systems that create the data for reports ran‐\\ndomly stop working, resulting in reports being delayed by several days. The data team\\ndoesn’t know until they’re asked by stakeholders why reports are late or producing\\nstale information.

Chapter 3\\ncovers data architecture in depth, but we want to highlight here that data architecture\\nis an undercurrent of the data engineering lifecycle.\\nA data engineer should first understand the needs of the business and gather require‐\\nments for new use cases. Next, a data engineer needs to translate those requirements\\nto design new ways to capture and serve data, balanced for cost and operational\\nsimplicity. This means knowing the trade-offs with design patterns, technologies, and\\ntools in source systems, ingestion, storage, transformation, and serving data.\\nThis doesn’t imply that a data engineer is a data architect, as these are typically two\\nseparate roles.

The DAG can be run once or scheduled to run at a fixed interval of daily,\\nweekly, every hour, every five minutes, etc.\\nAs we discuss orchestration throughout this book, we assume that an orchestration\\nsystem stays online with high availability. This allows the orchestration system to\\nsense and monitor constantly without human intervention and run new jobs anytime\\nthey are deployed. An orchestration system monitors jobs that it manages and kicks\\noff new tasks as internal DAG dependencies are completed. It can also monitor\\nexternal systems and tools to watch for data to arrive and criteria to be met. When\\ncertain conditions go out of bounds, the system also sets error conditions and sends\\nalerts through email or other channels.

Enterprises used\\nvarious tools to manage job flows, but these were expensive, out of reach of small\\nstartups, and generally not extensible. Apache Oozie was extremely popular in the\\n2010s, but it was designed to work within a Hadoop cluster and was difficult to use in\\na more heterogeneous environment.

Amazon might decide to require the use of DynamoDB for a new micro‐\\nservices database. If this policy doesn’t work, Amazon has the option of reversing it\\nand refactoring some services to use other databases. Since the stakes attached to each\\nreversible decision (two-way door) are low, organizations can make more decisions,\\niterating, improving, and collecting data rapidly.\\nChange management is closely related to reversible decisions and is a central theme\\nof enterprise architecture frameworks.

Indeed, this is partially true; patching a software\\nbug is much easier than redesigning and replacing an airplane wing. However, digi‐\\ntal systems are ultimately constrained by physical limits such as latency, reliability,\\ndensity, and energy consumption. Engineers also confront various nonphysical limits,\\nsuch as characteristics of programming languages and frameworks, and practical\\nconstraints in managing complexity, budgets, etc. Magical thinking culminates in\\npoor engineering.

When architects choose\\nwell and lead effectively, common components become a fabric facilitating team\\ncollaboration and breaking down silos. Common components enable agility within\\nand across teams in conjunction with shared knowledge and skills.\\nCommon components can be anything that has broad applicability within an orga‐\\nnization. Common components include object storage, version-control systems,\\nobservability, monitoring and orchestration systems, and processing engines. Com‐\\nmon components should be accessible to everyone with an appropriate use case,\\nand teams are encouraged to rely on common components already in use rather\\nthan reinventing the wheel. Common components must support robust permissions\\nand security to enable sharing of assets among teams while preventing unauthorized\\naccess.\\nCloud platforms are an ideal place to adopt common components. For example,\\ncompute and storage separation in cloud data systems allows users to access a shared\\nstorage layer (most commonly object storage) using specialized tools to access and\\nquery the data needed for specific use cases.\\n78 | Chapter 3: Designing Good Data Architecture'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 103, 'page_label': '78'}, page_content='8 UberPulse, “ Amazon.com CTO: Everything Fails, ” Y ouTube video, 3:03, https://oreil.ly/vDVlX.\\nChoosing common components is a balancing act. On the one hand, you need to\\nfocus on needs across the data engineering lifecycle and teams, utilize common\\ncomponents that will be useful for individual projects, and simultaneously facilitate\\ninteroperation and collaboration.

Even so, any hardware component\\nwill fail, given enough time. To build highly robust data systems, you must consider\\nfailures in your designs. Here are a few key terms for evaluating failure scenarios; we\\ndescribe these in greater detail in this chapter and throughout the book:\\nAvailability\\nThe percentage of time an IT service or component is in an operable state.\\nReliability\\nThe system’s probability of meeting defined standards in performing its intended\\nfunction during a specified interval.\\nRecovery time objective\\nThe maximum acceptable time for a service or system outage. The recovery time\\nobjective (RTO) is generally set by determining the business impact of an outage.\\nAn RTO of one day might be fine for an internal reporting system. A website\\noutage of just five minutes could have a significant adverse business impact on an\\nonline retailer.\\nRecovery point objective\\nThe acceptable state after recovery. In data systems, data is often lost during an\\noutage. In this setting, the recovery point objective (RPO) refers to the maximum\\nacceptable data loss.\\nEngineers need to consider acceptable reliability, availability, RTO, and RPO in\\ndesigning for failure. These will guide their architecture decisions as they assess\\npossible failure scenarios.\\nPrinciples of Good Data Architecture | 79'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 104, 'page_label': '79'}, page_content='Principle 3: Architect for Scalability\\nScalability in data systems encompasses two main capabilities. First, scalable systems\\ncan scale up  to handle significant quantities of data. We might need to spin up a\\nlarge cluster to train a model on a petabyte of customer data or scale out a streaming\\ningestion system to handle a transient load spike. Our ability to scale up allows us to\\nhandle extreme loads temporarily. Second, scalable systems can scale down. Once the\\nload spike ebbs, we should automatically remove capacity to cut costs. (This is related\\nto principle 9.) An elastic system can scale dynamically in response to load, ideally in\\nan automated fashion.\\nSome scalable systems can also scale to zero: they shut down completely when not in\\nuse. Once the large model-training job completes, we can delete the cluster. Many ser‐\\nverless systems (e.g., serverless functions and serverless online analytical processing,\\nor OLAP , databases) can automatically scale to zero.\\nNote that deploying inappropriate scaling strategies can result in overcomplicated\\nsystems and high costs. A straightforward relational database with one failover node\\nmay be appropriate for an application instead of a complex cluster arrangement.\\nMeasure your current load, approximate load spikes, and estimate load over the next\\nseveral years to determine if your database architecture is appropriate. If your startup\\ngrows much faster than anticipated, this growth should also lead to more available\\nresources to rearchitect for scalability.\\nPrinciple 4: Architecture Is Leadership\\nData architects are responsible for technology decisions and architecture descrip‐\\ntions and disseminating these choices through effective leadership and training.\\nData architects should be highly technically competent but delegate most individual\\ncontributor work to others. Strong leadership skills combined with high technical\\ncompetence are rare and extremely valuable. The best data architects take this duality\\nseriously.\\nNote that leadership does not imply a command-and-control approach to technology.\\nIt was not uncommon in the past for architects to choose one proprietary database\\ntechnology and force every team to house their data there. We oppose this approach\\nbecause it can significantly hinder current data projects. Cloud environments allow\\narchitects to balance common component choices with flexibility that enables inno‐\\nvation within projects.\\n80 | Chapter 3: Designing Good Data Architecture'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 105, 'page_label': '80'}, page_content='9 Martin Fowler, “Who Needs an Architect?” IEEE Software, July/August 2003, https://oreil.ly/wAMmZ.\\n10 Google Cloud, “DevOps Tech: Architecture, ” Cloud Architecture Center, https://oreil.ly/j4MT1.\\nReturning to the notion of technical leadership, Martin Fowler describes a specific\\narchetype of an ideal software architect, well embodied in his colleague Dave Rice:9\\nIn many ways, the most important activity of Architectus Oryzus  is to mentor the\\ndevelopment team, to raise their level so they can take on more complex issues.\\nImproving the development team’s ability gives an architect much greater leverage than\\nbeing the sole decision-maker and thus running the risk of being an architectural\\nbottleneck.\\nAn ideal data architect manifests similar characteristics. They possess the technical\\nskills of a data engineer but no longer practice data engineering day to day; they\\nmentor current data engineers, make careful technology choices in consultation with\\ntheir organization, and disseminate expertise through training and leadership. They\\ntrain engineers in best practices and bring the company’s engineering resources\\ntogether to pursue common goals in both technology and business.\\nAs a data engineer, you should practice architecture leadership and seek mentorship\\nfrom architects. Eventually, you may well occupy the architect role yourself.\\nPrinciple 5: Always Be Architecting\\nWe borrow this principle directly from Google Cloud’s Five Principles for Cloud-\\nNative Architecture. Data architects don’t serve in their role simply to maintain the\\nexisting state; instead, they constantly design new and exciting things in response\\nto changes in business and technology. Per the EABOK, an architect’s job is to\\ndevelop deep knowledge of the baseline architecture (current state), develop a  target\\narchitecture, and map out a sequencing plan to determine priorities and the order of\\narchitecture changes.\\nWe add that modern architecture should not be command-and-control or waterfall\\nbut collaborative and agile. The data architect maintains a target architecture and\\nsequencing plans that change over time. The target architecture becomes a moving\\ntarget, adjusted in response to business and technology changes internally and world‐\\nwide. The sequencing plan determines immediate priorities for delivery.\\nPrinciple 6: Build Loosely Coupled Systems\\nWhen the architecture of the system is designed to enable teams to test, deploy, and\\nchange systems without dependencies on other teams, teams require little communica‐\\ntion to get work done. In other words, both the architecture and the teams are loosely\\ncoupled.\\n—Google DevOps tech architecture guide10\\nPrinciples of Good Data Architecture | 81'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 106, 'page_label': '81'}, page_content='11 “The Bezos API Mandate: Amazon’s Manifesto for Externalization, ” Nordic APIs, January 19, 2021,\\nhttps://oreil.ly/vIs8m.\\nIn 2002, Bezos wrote an email to Amazon employees that became known as the Bezos\\nAPI Mandate:11\\n1.

All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up5.\\nto be externalizable.

No exceptions.\\nThe advent of Bezos’s API Mandate is widely viewed as a watershed moment for\\nAmazon. Putting data and services behind APIs enabled the loose coupling and\\neventually resulted in AWS as we know it now.

Systems are broken into many small components.1.\\n2. These systems interface with other services through abstraction layers, such as2.\\na messaging bus or an API.

In the movie, the CIA hosts highly sensitive data\\non a storage system inside a room with extremely tight physical security. Ethan Hunt\\ninfiltrates CIA headquarters and exploits a human target to gain physical access to the\\nstorage system. Once inside the secure room, he can exfiltrate data with relative ease.\\nFor at least a decade, alarming media reports have made us aware of the growing\\nmenace of security breaches that exploit human targets inside hardened organiza‐\\ntional security perimeters. Even as employees work on highly secure corporate\\nnetworks, they remain connected to the outside world through email and mobile\\ndevices. External threats effectively become internal threats.\\nIn a cloud-native environment, the notion of a hardened perimeter erodes further. All\\nassets are connected to the outside world to some degree. While virtual private cloud\\n(VPC) networks can be defined with no external connectivity, the API control plane\\nthat engineers use to define these networks still faces the internet.\\nThe shared responsibility model\\nAmazon emphasizes the shared responsibility model , which divides security into the\\nsecurity of the cloud and security in the cloud.

In an\\non-premises setting, data systems are generally acquired with a capital expenditure\\n(described more in Chapter 4) for a new system every few years in an on-premises\\nsetting. Responsible parties have to balance their budget against desired compute\\nand storage capacity. Overbuying entails wasted money, while underbuying means\\nhampering future data projects and driving significant personnel time to control\\nsystem load and data size; underbuying may require faster technology refresh cycles,\\nwith associated extra costs.\\nIn the cloud era, most data systems are pay-as-you-go and readily scalable. Systems\\ncan run on a cost-per-query model, cost-per-processing-capacity model, or another\\nvariant of a pay-as-you-go model. This approach can be far more efficient than the\\ncapital expenditure approach. It is now possible to scale up for high performance,\\nand then scale down to save money. However, the pay-as-you-go approach makes\\nspending far more dynamic. The new challenge for data leaders is to manage budgets,\\npriorities, and efficiency.\\nCloud tooling necessitates a set of processes for managing spending and resources. In\\nthe past, data engineers thought in terms of performance engineering—maximizing\\nthe performance for data processes on a fixed set of resources and buying adequate\\nresources for future needs. With FinOps, engineers need to learn to think about the\\ncost structures of cloud systems. For example, what is the appropriate mix of AWS\\nspot instances when running a distributed cluster? What is the most appropriate\\napproach for running a sizable daily job in terms of cost-effectiveness and perfor‐\\nmance?

Rather than simply monitor requests and CPU utilization for a web server,\\nFinOps might monitor the ongoing cost of serverless functions handling traffic, as\\nwell as spikes in spending trigger alerts. Just as systems are designed to fail gracefully\\nin excessive traffic, companies may consider adopting hard limits for spending, with\\ngraceful failure modes in response to spending spikes.\\nOps teams should also think in terms of cost attacks.

A domain is the real-world\\nsubject area for which you’re architecting. A service is a set of functionality whose\\ngoal is to accomplish a task. For example, you might have a sales order-processing\\nservice whose task is to process orders as they are created. The sales order-processing\\nservice’s only job is to process orders; it doesn’t provide other functionality, such as\\ninventory management or updating user profiles.\\nA domain can contain multiple services. For example, you might have a sales domain\\nwith three services: orders, invoicing, and products. Each service has particular tasks\\nthat support the sales domain.

If a system fails to meet performance\\nrequirements during a specified interval, it may become unresponsive. Thus low\\nreliability can lead to low availability. On the other hand, dynamic scaling helps\\nensure adequate performance without manual intervention from engineers—elastic‐\\nity improves reliability.\\nScalability can be realized in a variety of ways. For your services and domains, does\\na single machine handle everything? A single machine can be scaled vertically; you\\ncan increase resources (CPU, disk, memory, I/O). But there are hard limits to possible\\nresources on a single machine. Also, what happens if this machine dies? Given\\nenough time, some components will eventually fail. What’s your plan for backup and\\nfailover? Single machines generally can’t offer high availability and reliability.\\nWe utilize a distributed system to realize higher overall scaling capacity and increased\\navailability and reliability. Horizontal scaling allows you to add more machines to\\nsatisfy load and resource requirements ( Figure 3-4 ). Common horizontally scaled\\nsystems have a leader node that acts as the main point of contact for the instantiation,\\nprogress, and completion of workloads. When a workload is started, the leader node\\ndistributes tasks to the worker nodes within its system, completing the tasks and\\nreturning the results to the leader node. Typical modern distributed architectures also\\nbuild in redundancy. Data is replicated so that if a machine dies, the other machines\\ncan pick up where the missing server left off; the cluster may add more machines to\\nrestore capacity.\\nDistributed systems are widespread in the various data technologies you’ll use across\\nyour architecture. Almost every cloud data warehouse object storage system you\\nuse has some notion of distribution under the hood. Management details of the\\ndistributed system are typically abstracted away, allowing you to focus on high-level\\narchitecture instead of low-level plumbing.

Be sure to assign common standards, owner‐\\nship, responsibility, and accountability to the teams owning their respective domains\\nand services. Designing “good” data architecture relies on trade-offs between the tight\\nand loose coupling of domains and services.\\nIt’s worth noting that many of the ideas in this section originate in software develop‐\\nment.

A three-tier architecture consists of data, application logic, and presen‐\\ntation tiers (Figure 3-6). Each tier is isolated from the other, allowing for separation of\\nconcerns.

Though architectural practices in data are now adopting those from\\nsoftware development, it’s still common to see very monolithic, tightly coupled data\\narchitectures. Some of this is due to the nature of existing data technologies and the\\nway they integrate.\\nFor example, data pipelines might consume data from many sources ingested into a\\ncentral data warehouse. The central data warehouse is inherently monolithic. A move\\ntoward a microservices equivalent with a data warehouse is to decouple the workflow\\nwith domain-specific data pipelines connecting to corresponding domain-specific\\ndata warehouses. For example, the sales data pipeline connects to the sales-specific\\ndata warehouse, and the inventory and product domains follow a similar pattern.\\nRather than dogmatically preach microservices over monoliths (among other argu‐\\nments), we suggest you pragmatically use loose coupling as an ideal, while recogniz‐\\ning the state and limitations of the data technologies you’re using within your data\\narchitecture. Incorporate reversible technology choices that allow for modularity and\\nloose coupling whenever possible.\\nAs you can see in Figure 3-7, you separate the components of your architecture into\\ndifferent layers of concern in a vertical fashion. While a multitier architecture solves\\nthe technical challenges of decoupling shared resources, it does not address the com‐\\nplexity of sharing domains. Along the lines of single versus multitiered architecture,\\nyou should also consider how you separate the domains of your data architecture. For\\nexample, your analyst team might rely on data from sales and inventory. The sales\\nand inventory domains are different and should be viewed as separate.\\nOne approach to this problem is centralization: a single team is responsible for\\ngathering data from all domains and reconciling it for consumption across the orga‐\\nnization. (This is a common approach in traditional data warehousing.) Another\\napproach is the data mesh. With the data mesh, each software team is responsible for\\npreparing its data for consumption across the rest of the organization.

In\\nthis section, we outline prominent examples and types of data architecture that are\\npopular today. Though this set of examples is by no means exhaustive, the intention is\\nto expose you to some of the most common data architecture patterns and to get you\\nthinking about the requisite flexibility and trade-off analysis needed when designing\\na good architecture for your use case.\\nData Warehouse\\nA data warehouse is a central data hub used for reporting and analysis. Data in a\\ndata warehouse is typically highly formatted and structured for analytics use cases. It’s\\namong the oldest and most well-established data architectures.\\nIn 1989, Bill Inmon originated the notion of the data warehouse, which he described\\nas “a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data\\nin support of management’s decisions. ”22 Though technical aspects of the data ware‐\\nhouse have evolved significantly, we feel this original definition still holds its weight\\ntoday.\\nIn the past, data warehouses were widely used at enterprises with significant budgets\\n(often in the millions of dollars) to acquire data systems and pay internal teams\\nto provide ongoing support to maintain the data warehouse. This was expensive\\nand labor-intensive. Since then, the scalable, pay-as-you-go model has made cloud\\ndata warehouses accessible even to tiny companies. Because a third-party provider\\nmanages the data warehouse infrastructure, companies can do a lot more with fewer\\npeople, even as the complexity of their data grows.\\nIt’s worth noting two types of data warehouse architecture: organizational and tech‐\\nnical. The organizational data warehouse architecture organizes data associated with\\ncertain business team structures and processes. The technical data warehouse architec‐\\nture reflects the technical nature of the data warehouse, such as MPP . A company\\ncan have a data warehouse without an MPP system or run an MPP system that\\nis not organized as a data warehouse. However, the technical and organizational\\narchitectures have existed in a virtuous cycle and are frequently identified with each\\nother.\\n98 | Chapter 3: Designing Good Data Architecture'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 123, 'page_label': '98'}, page_content='The organizational data warehouse architecture has two main characteristics:\\nSeparates online analytical processing (OLAP) from production databases (online trans‐\\naction processing)\\nThis separation is critical as businesses grow.

Ingestion begins with an IoT gateway, as discussed previously. From there,\\nevents and measurements can flow into an event ingestion architecture.\\nOf course, other patterns are possible. For instance, the gateway may accumulate\\ndata and upload it in batches for later analytics processing. In remote physical envi‐\\nronments, gateways may not have connectivity to a network much of the time. They\\nmay upload all data only when they are brought into the range of a cellular or WiFi\\nnetwork. The point is that the diversity of IoT systems and environments presents\\ncomplications—e.g., late-arriving data, data structure and schema disparities, data\\ncorruption, and connection disruption—that engineers must account for in their\\narchitectures and downstream analytics.\\nStorage.    Storage requirements will depend a great deal on the latency requirement\\nfor the IoT devices in the system. For example, for remote sensors collecting scientific\\ndata for analysis at a later time, batch object storage may be perfectly acceptable.\\nHowever, near real-time responses may be expected from a system backend that\\nconstantly analyzes data in a home monitoring and automation solution. In this case,\\na message queue or time-series database is more appropriate. We discuss storage\\nsystems in more detail in Chapter 6.\\nServing.    Serving patterns are incredibly diverse. In a batch scientific application, data\\nmight be analyzed using a cloud data warehouse and then served in a report. Data\\nwill be presented and served in numerous ways in a home-monitoring application.\\nData will be analyzed in the near time using a stream-processing engine or queries\\nin a time-series database to look for critical events such as a fire, electrical outage,\\nor break-in. Detection of an anomaly will trigger alerts to the homeowner, the fire\\ndepartment, or other entity. A batch analytics component also exists—for example, a\\nmonthly report on the state of the home.\\nOne significant serving pattern for IoT looks like reverse ETL ( Figure 3-17), although\\nwe tend not to use this term in the IoT context. Think of this scenario: data from\\nsensors on manufacturing devices is collected and analyzed. The results of these\\nmeasurements are processed to look for optimizations that will allow equipment to\\noperate more efficiently. Data is sent back to reconfigure the devices and optimize\\nthem.\\nFigure 3-17.

Bigger companies may still employ data\\narchitects, but those architects will need to be heavily in tune and current with the\\nstate of technology and data. Gone are the days of ivory tower data architecture. In\\nthe past, architecture was largely orthogonal to engineering. We expect this distinc‐\\ntion will disappear as data engineering, and engineering in general, quickly evolves,\\nbecoming more agile, with less separation between engineering and architecture.\\nIdeally, a data engineer will work alongside a dedicated data architect. However, if\\na company is small or low in its level of data maturity, a data engineer might work\\ndouble duty as an architect. Because data architecture is an undercurrent of the data\\nengineering lifecycle, a data engineer should understand “good” architecture and the\\nvarious types of data architecture.\\nWhen designing architecture, you’ll work alongside  business stakeholders to evaluate\\ntrade-offs. What are the trade-offs inherent in adopting a cloud data warehouse\\nversus a data lake? What are the trade-offs of various cloud platforms? When might a\\nunified batch/streaming framework (Beam, Flink) be an appropriate choice? Studying\\nthese choices in the abstract will prepare you to make concrete, valuable decisions.\\nConclusion\\nY ou’ve learned how data architecture fits into the data engineering lifecycle and\\nwhat makes for “good” data architecture, and you’ve seen several examples of data\\narchitectures. Because architecture is such a key foundation for success, we encourage\\nyou to invest the time to study it deeply and understand the trade-offs inherent in any\\narchitecture.

Are you on a small team (perhaps a team of one) of people who are expected to\\nwear many hats, or is the team large enough that people work in specialized roles?\\nWill a handful of people be responsible for multiple stages of the data engineering\\nlifecycle, or do people cover particular niches? Y our team’s size will influence the\\ntypes of technologies you adopt.\\nThere is a continuum of simple to complex technologies, and a team’s size roughly\\ndetermines the amount of bandwidth your team can dedicate to complex solutions.\\nWe sometimes see small data teams read blog posts about a new cutting-edge tech‐\\nnology at a giant tech company and then try to emulate these same extremely com‐\\nplex technologies and practices. We call this cargo-cult engineering, and it’s generally\\na big mistake that consumes a lot of valuable time and money, often with little to\\nnothing to show in return.

We look at costs through three main\\nlenses: total cost of ownership, opportunity cost, and FinOps.\\nTotal Cost of Ownership\\nTotal cost of ownership  (TCO) is the total estimated cost of an initiative, including\\nthe direct and indirect costs of products and services utilized. Direct costs  can be\\ndirectly attributed to an initiative. Examples are the salaries of a team working on\\nthe initiative or the AWS bill for all services consumed. Indirect costs, also known\\nas overhead, are independent of the initiative and must be paid regardless of where\\nthey’re attributed.\\nApart from direct and indirect costs, how something is purchased  impacts the way\\ncosts are accounted for. Expenses fall into two big groups: capital expenses and\\noperational expenses.\\nCapital expenses, also known as capex, require an up-front investment. Payment is\\nrequired today. Before the cloud existed, companies would typically purchase hard‐\\nware and software up front through large acquisition contracts. In addition, signifi‐\\ncant investments were required to host hardware in server rooms, data centers, and\\ncolocation facilities.

From a budget perspective, capital was required to fund the entire purchase.\\nThis is capex, a significant capital outlay with a long-term plan to achieve a positive\\nROI on the effort and expense put forth.\\nOperational expenses , also known as opex, are the opposite of capex in certain\\nrespects. Opex is gradual and spread out over time. Whereas capex is long-term\\nfocused, opex is short-term. Opex can be pay-as-you-go or similar and allows a lot of\\nflexibility. Opex is closer to a direct cost, making it easier to attribute to a data project.\\nUntil recently, opex wasn’t an option for large data projects. Data systems often\\nrequired multimillion-dollar contracts. This has changed with the advent of the\\ncloud, as data platform services allow engineers to pay on a consumption-based\\nmodel. In general, opex allows for a far greater ability for engineering teams to\\nchoose their software and hardware. Cloud-based services let data engineers iterate\\nquickly with various software and technology configurations, often inexpensively.\\nData engineers need to be pragmatic about flexibility. The data landscape is changing\\ntoo quickly to invest in long-term hardware that inevitably goes stale, can’t easily\\nscale, and potentially hampers a data engineer’s flexibility to try new things. Given the\\nupside for flexibility and low initial costs, we urge data engineers to take an opex-first\\napproach centered on the cloud and flexible, pay-as-you-go technologies.\\nTotal Opportunity Cost of Ownership\\nAny choice inherently excludes other possibilities. Total opportunity cost of ownership\\n(TOCO) is the cost of lost opportunities that we incur in choosing a technology,\\nan architecture, or a process. 1 Note that ownership in this setting doesn’t require\\nlong-term purchases of hardware or licenses. Even in a cloud environment, we\\neffectively own a technology, a stack, or a pipeline once it becomes a core part of\\nour production data processes and is difficult to move away from.

Y our answers to these questions should inform your decisions about\\nyour architecture and thus the technologies used within that architecture. This is\\ndone by understanding what is likely to change and what tends to stay the same.\\nWe have two classes of tools to consider: immutable and transitory. Immutable tech‐\\nnologies might be components that underpin the cloud or languages and paradigms\\nthat have stood the test of time. In the cloud, examples of immutable technologies are\\nobject storage, networking, servers, and security. Object storage such as Amazon S3\\nand Azure Blob Storage will be around from today until the end of the decade, and\\nprobably much longer. Storing your data in object storage is a wise choice. Object\\nstorage continues to improve in various ways and constantly offers new options, but\\nyour data will be safe and usable in object storage regardless of the rapid evolution of\\ntechnology as a whole.\\nFor languages, SQL and bash have been around for many decades, and we don’t see\\nthem disappearing anytime soon.

We suggest applying the Lindy effect as a litmus test to\\ndetermine whether a technology is potentially immutable.\\nTransitory technologies are those that come and go. The typical trajectory begins\\nwith a lot of hype, followed by meteoric growth in popularity, then a slow descent\\ninto obscurity. The JavaScript frontend landscape is a classic example. How many\\nJavaScript frontend frameworks have come and gone between 2010 and 2020?

How is this possible?\\nHere’s our educated guess. When purchasing cloud storage, each disk in a storage\\ncluster has three assets that cloud providers and consumers use. First, it has a certain\\nstorage capacity—say, 10 TB. Second, it supports a certain number of input/output\\noperations (IOPs) per second—say, 100. Third, disks support a certain maximum\\nbandwidth, the maximum read speed for optimally organized files. A magnetic drive\\nmight be capable of reading at 200 MB/s.\\nAny of these limits (IOPs, storage capacity, bandwidth) is a potential bottleneck for\\na cloud provider. For instance, the cloud provider might have a disk storing 3 TB of\\ndata but hitting maximum IOPs. An alternative to leaving the remaining 7 TB empty\\nis to sell the empty space without selling IOPs. Or, more specifically, sell cheap storage\\nspace and expensive IOPs to discourage reads.\\nMuch like traders of financial derivatives, cloud vendors also deal in risk. In the case\\nof archival storage, vendors are selling a type of insurance, but one that pays out for\\nthe insurer rather than the policy buyer in the event of a catastrophe.

Snowflake and\\nDatabricks provide their SaaS offerings across multiple clouds for this reason. This\\nis especially critical for data-intensive applications, where network latency and band‐\\nwidth limitations hamper performance, and data egress costs can be prohibitive.\\nAnother common motivation for employing a multicloud approach is to take advan‐\\ntage of the best services across several clouds. For example, a company might want to\\nhandle its Google Ads and Analytics data on Google Cloud and deploy Kubernetes\\nthrough GKE. And the company might also adopt Azure specifically for Microsoft\\nworkloads. Also, the company may like AWS because it has several best-in-class\\nservices (e.g., AWS Lambda) and enjoys huge mindshare, making it relatively easy\\nto hire AWS-proficient engineers. Any mix of various cloud provider services is\\npossible. Given the intense competition among the major cloud providers, expect\\nthem to offer more best-of-breed services, making multicloud more compelling.\\n128 | Chapter 4: Choosing Technologies Across the Data Engineering Lifecycle'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 153, 'page_label': '128'}, page_content='A multicloud methodology has several disadvantages.

At the time of this writing, the good times of freely\\navailable capital for data companies are coming to an end, but that’s another long\\nstory whose consequences are still unfolding.\\nOften a company selling a data tool will not release it as OSS, instead offering\\na proprietary solution. Although you won’t have the transparency of a pure OSS\\nsolution, a proprietary independent solution can work quite well, especially as a fully\\nmanaged service in the cloud.\\nThe following are things to consider with an independent offering:\\nInteroperability\\nMake sure that the tool interoperates with other tools you’ve chosen (OSS, other\\nindependents, cloud offerings, etc.). Interoperability is key, so make sure you can\\ntry it before you buy.\\nMindshare and market share\\nIs the solution popular? Does it command a presence in the marketplace?

Monolithic systems are self-contained, often performing multiple func‐\\ntions under a single system. The monolith camp favors the simplicity of having\\neverything in one place. It’s easier to reason about a single entity, and you can\\nmove faster because there are fewer moving parts. The modular camp leans toward\\ndecoupled, best-of-breed technologies performing tasks at which they are uniquely\\ngreat. Especially given the rate of change in products in the data world, the argument\\nis you should aim for interoperability among an ever-changing array of solutions.\\nWhat approach should you take in your data engineering stack? Let’s explore the\\ntrade-offs.\\nMonolith\\nThe monolith (Figure 4-4) has been a technology mainstay for decades. The old days\\nof waterfall meant that software releases were huge, tightly coupled, and moved at\\na slow cadence. Large teams worked together to deliver a single working codebase.\\nMonolithic data systems continue to this day, with older software vendors such as\\nInformatica and open source frameworks such as Spark.\\nThe pros of the monolith are it’s easy to reason about, and it requires a lower\\ncognitive burden and context switching since everything is self-contained. Instead of\\ndealing with dozens of technologies, you deal with “one” technology and typically\\none principal programming language. Monoliths are an excellent option if you want\\nsimplicity in reasoning about your architecture and processes.\\nMonolith Versus Modular | 139'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 164, 'page_label': '139'}, page_content='Figure 4-4. The monolith tightly couples its services\\nOf course, the monolith has cons. For one thing, monoliths are brittle. Because of the\\nvast number of moving parts, updates and releases take longer and tend to bake in\\n“the kitchen sink. ” If the system has a bug—hopefully, the software’s been thoroughly\\ntested before release!—it can harm the entire system.\\nUser-induced problems also happen with monoliths. For example, we saw a mono‐\\nlithic ETL pipeline that took 48 hours to run. If anything broke anywhere in the\\npipeline, the entire process had to restart. Meanwhile, anxious business users were\\nwaiting for their reports, which were already two days late by default and usually\\narrived much later. Breakages were common enough that the monolithic system was\\neventually thrown out.\\nMultitenancy in a monolithic system can also be a significant problem. It can be\\nchallenging to isolate the workloads of multiple users. In an on-prem data warehouse,\\none user-defined function might consume enough CPU to slow the system for other\\nusers. Conflicts between dependencies and resource contention are frequent sources\\nof headaches.\\nAnother con of monoliths is that switching to a new system will be painful if the\\nvendor or open source project dies. Because all of your processes are contained in\\nthe monolith, extracting yourself out of that system, and onto a new platform, will be\\ncostly in both time and money.\\nModularity\\nModularity (Figure 4-5 ) is an old concept in software engineering, but modular\\ndistributed systems truly came into vogue with the rise of microservices. Instead of\\nrelying on a massive monolith to handle your needs, why not break apart systems and\\nprocesses into their self-contained areas of concern? Microservices can communicate\\nvia APIs, allowing developers to focus on their domains while making their applica‐\\ntions accessible to other microservices.

The\\nfamous Bezos API mandate decreases coupling between applications, allowing refac‐\\ntoring and decomposition.

Any processing tool that sup‐\\nports the format can read the data and write processed results back into the lake\\nfor processing by another tool.

Orchestration becomes\\nthe glue that binds data stack modules together.\\nThe Distributed Monolith Pattern\\nThe distributed monolith pattern  is a distributed architecture that still suffers from\\nmany of the limitations of monolithic architecture. The basic idea is that one runs a\\ndistributed system with different services to perform different tasks. Still, services and\\nnodes share a common set of dependencies or a common codebase.\\nOne standard example is a traditional Hadoop cluster. A Hadoop cluster can simulta‐\\nneously host several frameworks, such as Hive, Pig, or Spark. The cluster also has\\nmany internal dependencies. In addition, the cluster runs core Hadoop components:\\nHadoop common libraries, HDFS, YARN, and Java. In practice, a cluster often has\\none version of each component installed.\\nA standard on-prem Hadoop system entails managing a common environment that\\nworks for all users and all jobs. Managing upgrades and installations is a significant\\nchallenge. Forcing jobs to upgrade dependencies risks breaking them; maintaining\\ntwo versions of a framework entails extra complexity.\\nSome modern Python-based orchestration technologies—e.g., Apache Airflow—also\\nsuffer from this problem. While they utilize a highly decoupled and asynchronous\\narchitecture, every service runs the same codebase with the same dependencies. Any\\nexecutor can execute any task, so a client library for a single task run in one DAG\\nmust be installed on the whole cluster. Orchestrating many tools entails installing\\nclient libraries for a host of APIs. Dependency conflicts are a constant problem.\\nOne solution to the problems of the distributed monolith is ephemeral infrastructure\\nin a cloud setting. Each job gets its own temporary server or cluster installed with\\ndependencies. Each cluster remains highly monolithic, but separating jobs dramati‐\\ncally reduces conflicts. For example, this pattern is now quite common for Spark with\\nservices like Amazon EMR and Google Cloud Dataproc.\\nA second solution is to properly decompose the distributed monolith into multiple\\nsoftware environments using containers. We have more to say on containers in\\n“Serverless Versus Servers” on page 143.\\nOur Advice\\nWhile monoliths are attractive because of ease of understanding and reduced com‐\\nplexity, this comes at a high cost.

With the promise of executing small\\nchunks of code on an as-needed basis without having to manage a server, serverless\\nexploded in popularity. The main reasons for its popularity are cost and convenience.\\nInstead of paying the cost of a server, why not just pay when your code is evoked?\\nServerless has many flavors. Though function as a service (FaaS) is wildly popular,\\nserverless systems predate the advent of AWS Lambda. For example, Google Cloud’s\\nBigQuery is serverless in that data engineers don’t need to manage backend infra‐\\nstructure, and the system scales to zero and scales up automatically to handle large\\nqueries. Just load data into the system and start querying. Y ou pay for the amount\\nof data your query consumes and a small cost to store your data. This payment\\nmodel—paying for consumption and storage—is becoming more prevalent.\\nWhen does serverless make sense? As with many other cloud services, it depends;\\nand data engineers would do well to understand the details of cloud pricing to\\npredict when serverless deployments will become expensive. Looking specifically at\\nthe case of AWS Lambda, various engineers have found hacks to run batch workloads\\nat meager costs. 11 On the other hand, serverless functions suffer from an inherent\\noverhead inefficiency.

At the time of this writing, containers continue to grow in popularity,\\nalong with Kubernetes, a container management system. Serverless environments\\ntypically run on containers behind the scenes. Indeed, Kubernetes is a kind of server‐\\nless environment because it allows developers and ops teams to deploy microservices\\nwithout worrying about the details of the machines where they are deployed.\\nContainers provide a partial solution to problems of the distributed monolith men‐\\ntioned earlier in this chapter. For example, Hadoop now supports containers, allow‐\\ning each job to have its own isolated dependencies.\\nContainer clusters do not provide the same security and isola‐\\ntion that full VMs offer. Container escape —broadly, a class of\\nexploits whereby code in a container gains privileges outside the\\ncontainer at the OS level—is common enough to be considered a\\nrisk for multitenancy. While Amazon EC2 is a truly multitenant\\nenvironment with VMs from many customers hosted on the same\\nhardware, a Kubernetes cluster should host code only within an\\nenvironment of mutual trust (e.g., inside the walls of a single\\ncompany).

Do your homework before\\nblindly relying on vendor benchmarks to evaluate and choose technology.\\nUndercurrents and Their Impacts\\non Choosing Technologies\\nAs seen in this chapter, a data engineer has a lot to consider when evaluating technol‐\\nogies. Whatever technology you choose, be sure to understand how it supports the\\nundercurrents of the data engineering lifecycle. Let’s briefly review them again.\\nData Management\\nData management is a broad area, and concerning technologies, it isn’t always appa‐\\nrent whether a technology adopts data management as a principal concern. For\\nexample, behind the scenes, a third-party vendor may use data management best\\npractices—regulatory compliance, security, privacy, data quality, and governance—\\nbut hide these details behind a limited UI layer. In this case, while evaluating the\\nproduct, it helps to ask the company about its data management practices. Here are\\nsome sample questions you should ask:\\n• How are you protecting data against breaches, both from the outside and within?•\\n• What is your product’s compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy•\\nregulations?\\n• Do you allow me to host my data to comply with these regulations?•\\n• How do you ensure data quality and that I’m viewing the correct data in your•\\nsolution?\\nThere are many other questions to ask, and these are just a few of the ways to think\\nabout data management as it relates to choosing the right technologies. These same\\nquestions should also apply to the OSS solutions you’re considering.\\nDataOps\\nProblems will happen. They just will. A server or database may die, a cloud’s region\\nmay have an outage, you might deploy buggy code, bad data might be introduced into\\nyour data warehouse, and other unforeseen problems may occur.\\nUndercurrents and Their Impacts on Choosing Technologies | 149'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 174, 'page_label': '149'}, page_content='When evaluating a new technology, how much control do you have over deploying\\nnew code, how will you be alerted if there’s a problem, and how will you respond\\nwhen there’s a problem? The answer largely depends on the type of technology\\nyou’re considering. If the technology is OSS, you’re likely responsible for setting up\\nmonitoring, hosting, and code deployment. How will you handle issues? What’s your\\nincident response?\\nMuch of the operations are outside your control if you’re using a managed offering.\\nConsider the vendor’s SLA, the way they alert you to issues, and whether they’re\\ntransparent about how they’re addressing the case, including providing an ETA to a\\nfix.\\nData Architecture\\nAs discussed in Chapter 3 , good data architecture means assessing trade-offs and\\nchoosing the best tools for the job while keeping your decisions reversible. With the\\ndata landscape morphing at warp speed, the best tool for the job is a moving target.\\nThe main goals are to avoid unnecessary lock-in, ensure interoperability across the\\ndata stack, and produce high ROI. Choose your technologies accordingly.\\nOrchestration Example: Airflow\\nThroughout most of this chapter, we have actively avoided discussing any particular\\ntechnology too extensively. We make an exception for orchestration because the space\\nis currently dominated by one open source technology, Apache Airflow.\\nMaxime Beauchemin kicked off the Airflow project at Airbnb in 2014. Airflow\\nwas developed from the beginning as a noncommercial open source project. The\\nframework quickly grew significant mindshare outside Airbnb, becoming an Apache\\nIncubator project in 2016 and a full Apache-sponsored project in 2019.\\nAirflow enjoys many advantages, largely because of its dominant position in the open\\nsource marketplace. First, the Airflow open source project is extremely active, with a\\nhigh rate of commits and a quick response time for bugs and security issues, and the\\nproject recently released Airflow 2, a major refactor of the codebase. Second, Airflow\\nenjoys massive mindshare. Airflow has a vibrant, active community on many com‐\\nmunications platforms, including Slack, Stack Overflow, and GitHub. Users can easily\\nfind answers to questions and problems. Third, Airflow is available commercially as\\na managed service or software distribution through many vendors, including GCP ,\\nAWS, and Astronomer.io.\\nAirflow also has some downsides. Airflow relies on a few core nonscalable compo‐\\nnents (the scheduler and backend database) that can become bottlenecks for perfor‐\\nmance, scale, and reliability; the scalable parts of Airflow still follow a distributed\\nmonolith pattern.

Prefect\\nand Dagster aim to solve some of the problems discussed previously by rethinking\\ncomponents of the Airflow architecture. Will there be other orchestration frame‐\\nworks and technologies not discussed here? Plan on it.\\nWe highly recommend that anyone choosing an orchestration technology study the\\noptions discussed here. They should also acquaint themselves with activity in the\\nspace, as new developments will certainly occur by the time you read this.\\nSoftware Engineering\\nAs a data engineer, you should strive for simplification and abstraction across the\\ndata stack. Buy or use prebuilt open source solutions whenever possible. Eliminating\\nundifferentiated heavy lifting should be your big goal. Focus your resources—custom\\ncoding and tooling—on areas that give you a solid competitive advantage. For exam‐\\nple, is hand-coding a database connection between your production database and\\nyour cloud data warehouse a competitive advantage for you? Probably not. This is\\nvery much a solved problem. Pick an off-the-shelf solution (open source or managed\\nSaaS) instead. The world doesn’t need the millionth +1 database-to-cloud data ware‐\\nhouse connector.\\nOn the other hand, why do customers buy from you? Y our business likely has\\nsomething special about the way it does things. Maybe it’s a particular algorithm that\\npowers your fintech platform. By abstracting away a lot of the redundant workflows\\nand processes, you can continue chipping away, refining, and customizing the things\\nthat move the needle for the business.\\nConclusion\\nChoosing the right technologies is no easy task, especially when new technologies\\nand patterns emerge daily. Today is possibly the most confusing time in history for\\nevaluating and selecting technologies. Choosing technologies is a balance of use case,\\ncost, build versus buy, and modularization. Always approach technology the same\\nway as architecture: assess trade-offs and aim for reversible decisions.\\nAdditional Resources\\n• Cloud FinOps by J. R.

Data is an unorganized,\\ncontext-less collection of facts and figures. It can be created in many ways, both\\nanalog and digital.\\nAnalog data creation occurs in the real world, such as vocal speech, sign language,\\nwriting on paper, or playing an instrument. This analog data is often transient; how\\noften have you had a verbal conversation whose contents are lost to the ether after the\\nconversation ends?\\nDigital data is either created by converting analog data to digital form or is the native\\nproduct of a digital system. An example of analog to digital is a mobile texting app\\nthat converts analog speech into digital text. An example of digital data creation is a\\ncredit card transaction on an ecommerce platform. A customer places an order, the\\ntransaction is charged to their credit card, and the information for the transaction is\\nsaved to various databases.\\nWe’ll utilize a few common examples in this chapter, such as data created when\\ninteracting with a website or mobile application. But in truth, data is everywhere\\nin the world around us. We capture data from IoT devices, credit card terminals,\\ntelescope sensors, stock trades, and more.\\nGet familiar with your source system and how it generates data.

OLTP systems\\nare often referred to as transactional databases, but this does not necessarily imply\\nthat the system in question supports atomic transactions.\\nMore generally, OLTP databases support low latency and high concurrency. An\\nRDBMS database can select or update a row in less than a millisecond (not account‐\\ning for network latency) and handle thousands of reads and writes per second. A\\ndocument database cluster can manage even higher document commit rates at the\\nexpense of potential inconsistency.

Consistency means that any database read will return\\nthe last written version of the retrieved item. Isolation entails that if two updates are\\nin flight concurrently for the same thing, the end database state will be consistent\\nwith the sequential execution of these updates in the order they were submitted.\\nDurability indicates that committed data will never be lost, even in the event of power\\nloss.\\nNote that ACID characteristics are not required to support application backends,\\nand relaxing these constraints can be a considerable boon to performance and scale.\\nHowever, ACID characteristics guarantee that the database will maintain a consistent\\npicture of the world, dramatically simplifying the app developer’s task.\\nAll engineers (data or otherwise) must understand operating with and without ACID.\\nFor instance, to improve performance, some distributed databases use relaxed consis‐\\ntency constraints, such as eventual consistency, to improve performance.

In\\nthe example in Figure 5-2, a traditional banking application running on an RDBMS\\nexecutes a SQL statement that checks two account balances, one in Account A (the\\nsource) and another in Account B (the destination). Money is then moved from\\nAccount A to Account B if sufficient funds are in Account A. The entire transaction\\nshould run with updates to both account balances or fail without updating either\\naccount balance. That is, the whole operation should happen as a transaction.\\nFigure 5-2.

The online part of OLAP\\nimplies that the system constantly listens for incoming queries, making OLAP sys‐\\ntems suitable for interactive analytics.\\nAlthough this chapter covers source systems, OLAPs are typically storage and query\\nsystems for analytics. Why are we talking about them in our chapter on source\\nsystems? In practical use cases, engineers often need to read data from an OLAP\\nsystem.

Database logs record operations on a table\\nCRUD\\nCRUD, which stands for create, read, update, and delete, is a transactional pattern\\ncommonly used in programming and represents the four basic operations of persis‐\\ntent storage. CRUD is the most common pattern for storing application state in a\\ndatabase. A basic tenet of CRUD is that data must be created before being used. After\\nthe data has been created, the data can be read and updated. Finally, the data may\\nneed to be destroyed. CRUD guarantees these four operations will occur on data,\\nregardless of its storage.\\nCRUD is a widely used pattern in software applications, and you’ll commonly find\\nCRUD used in APIs and databases. For example, a web application will make heavy\\nuse of CRUD for RESTful HTTP requests and storing and retrieving data from a\\ndatabase.\\nAs with any database, we can use snapshot-based extraction to get data from a\\ndatabase where our application applies CRUD operations. On the other hand, event\\nextraction with CDC gives us a complete history of operations and potentially allows\\nfor near real-time analytics.\\nInsert-Only\\nThe insert-only pattern  retains history directly in a table containing data. Rather\\nthan updating records, new records get inserted with a timestamp indicating when\\nthey were created ( Table 5-1). For example, suppose you have a table of customer\\naddresses. Following a CRUD pattern, you would simply update the record if the\\ncustomer changed their address. With the insert-only pattern, a new address record\\nis inserted with the same customer ID.

(Streams are ingested\\nand stored in event-streaming platforms, which we discuss at greater length in “Mes‐\\nsages and Streams” on page 163.) As events occur, they are accumulated in an ordered\\nsequence ( Figure 5-5 ); a timestamp or an ID might order events.

We often see that people start with a relational database under the\\nimpression it’s a universal appliance and shoehorn in a ton of use cases and work‐\\nloads. As data and query requirements morph, the relational database collapses under\\nits weight. At that point, you’ll want to use a database that’s appropriate for the\\nspecific workload under pressure. Enter nonrelational or NoSQL databases. NoSQL,\\nwhich stands for not only SQL, refers to a whole class of databases that abandon the\\nrelational paradigm.\\nOn the one hand, dropping relational constraints can improve performance, scala‐\\nbility, and schema flexibility. But as always in architecture, trade-offs exist. NoSQL\\ndatabases also typically abandon various RDBMS characteristics, such as strong con‐\\nsistency, joins, or a fixed schema.\\nA big theme of this book is that data innovation is constant. Let’s take a quick look at\\nthe history of NoSQL, as it’s helpful to gain a perspective on why and how data inno‐\\nvations impact your work as a data engineer. In the early 2000s, tech companies such\\nas Google and Amazon began to outgrow their relational databases and pioneered\\nnew distributed, nonrelational databases to scale their web platforms.\\nWhile the term NoSQL first appeared in 1998, the modern version was coined by Eric\\nEvans in the 2000s.1 He tells the story in a 2009 blog post:\\nI’ve spent the last couple of days at nosqleast and one of the hot topics here is the\\nname “nosql. ” Understandably, there are a lot of people who worry that the name is\\nBad, that it sends an inappropriate or inaccurate message. While I make no claims to\\nthe idea, I do have to accept some blame for what it is now being called.

Because there are far too many NoSQL databases to cover exhaustively\\nin this section, we consider the following database types: key-value, document,\\nwide-column, graph, search, and time series. These databases are all wildly popular\\nand enjoy widespread adoption. A data engineer should understand these types of\\ndatabases, including usage considerations, the structure of the data they store, and\\nhow to leverage each in the data engineering lifecycle.\\nKey-value stores.    A key-value database  is a nonrelational database that retrieves\\nrecords using a key that uniquely identifies each record. This is similar to hash\\nmap or dictionary data structures presented in many programming languages but\\npotentially more scalable. Key-value stores encompass several NoSQL database types\\n—for example, document stores and wide column databases (discussed next).\\nDifferent types of key-value databases offer a variety of performance characteristics\\nto serve various application needs. For example, in-memory key-value databases are\\npopular for caching session data for web and mobile applications, where ultra-fast\\nlookup and high concurrency are required. Storage in these systems is typically\\ntemporary; if the database shuts down, the data disappears. Such caches can reduce\\npressure on the main application database and serve speedy responses.\\nOf course, key-value stores can also serve applications requiring high-durability per‐\\nsistence. An ecommerce application may need to save and update massive amounts\\nof event state changes for a user and their orders. A user logs into the ecommerce\\napplication, clicks around various screens, adds items to a shopping cart, and then\\nchecks out. Each event must be durably stored for retrieval. Key-value stores often\\npersist data to disk and across multiple nodes to support such use cases.\\nDocument stores.    As mentioned previously, a document store is a specialized key-value\\nstore.

For example,\\nyou could set an index on name.\\nAnother critical technical detail for data engineers is that document stores are\\ngenerally not ACID compliant, unlike relational databases. Technical expertise in\\na particular document store is essential to understanding performance, tuning, con‐\\nfiguration, related effects on writes, consistency, durability, etc. For example, many\\ndocument stores are eventually consistent. Allowing data distribution across a cluster\\nis a boon for scaling and performance but can lead to catastrophes when engineers\\nand developers don’t understand the implications.2\\nTo run analytics on document stores, engineers generally must run a full scan to\\nextract all data from a collection or employ a CDC strategy to send events to a target\\nstream. The full scan approach can have both performance and cost implications. The\\nscan often slows the database as it runs, and many serverless cloud offerings charge a\\nsignificant fee for each full scan.

A wide-column database  is optimized for storing massive amounts\\nof data with high transaction rates and extremely low latency. These databases\\ncan scale to extremely high write rates and vast amounts of data.

They have only a single index (the row key) for lookups. Data\\nengineers must generally extract data and send it to a secondary analytics system\\nto run complex queries to deal with these limitations. This can be accomplished by\\nrunning large scans for the extraction or employing CDC to capture an event stream.\\nSource System Practical Details | 171'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 196, 'page_label': '171'}, page_content='3 Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly, 2017), 49,\\nhttps://oreil.ly/v1NhG.\\n4 Aashish Mehra, “Graph Database Market Worth $5.1 Billion by 2026: Exclusive Report by MarketsandMar‐\\nkets, ” Cision PR Newswire, July 30, 2021, https://oreil.ly/mGVkY.\\nGraph databases.    Graph databases explicitly store data with a mathematical graph\\nstructure (as a set of nodes and edges). 3 Neo4j has proven extremely popular, while\\nAmazon, Oracle, and other vendors offer their graph database products. Roughly\\nspeaking, graph databases are a good fit when you want to analyze the connectivity\\nbetween elements.\\nFor example, you could use a document database to store one document for each\\nuser describing their properties. Y ou could add an array element for connections\\nthat contains directly connected users’ IDs in a social media context. It’s pretty easy\\nto determine the number of direct connections a user has, but suppose you want\\nto know how many users can be reached by traversing two direct connections.\\nY ou could answer this question by writing complex code, but each query would\\nrun slowly and consume significant resources. The document store is simply not\\noptimized for this use case.\\nGraph databases are designed for precisely this type of query. Their data structures\\nallow for queries based on the connectivity between elements; graph databases are\\nindicated when we care about understanding complex traversals between elements.\\nIn the parlance of graphs, we store nodes (users in the preceding example) and\\nedges (connections between users). Graph databases support rich data models for\\nboth nodes and edges.

Log analysis  is typically used for\\nanomaly detection, real-time monitoring, security analytics, and operational analyt‐\\nics.

A time series is a series of values organized by time. For example, stock\\nprices might move as trades are executed throughout the day, or a weather sensor\\nwill take atmospheric temperatures every minute.

As noted in\\nChapter 4 , REST stands for representational state transfer. This set of practices and\\nphilosophies for building HTTP web APIs was laid out by Roy Fielding in 2000 in\\na PhD dissertation. REST is built around HTTP verbs, such as GET and PUT; in\\npractice, modern REST uses only a handful of the verb mappings outlined in the\\noriginal dissertation.\\nOne of the principal ideas of REST is that interactions are stateless. Unlike in a Linux\\nterminal session, there is no notion of a session with associated state variables such\\nas a working directory; each REST call is independent. REST calls can change the\\nsystem’s state, but these changes are global, applying to the full system rather than a\\ncurrent session.\\n174 | Chapter 5: Data Generation in Source Systems'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 199, 'page_label': '174'}, page_content='5 For one example, see Michael S.

In some cases, APIs are merely\\na thin wrapper over internals that provides the minimum functionality required to\\nprotect the system from user requests. In other examples, a REST data API is a\\nmasterpiece of engineering that prepares data for analytics applications and supports\\nadvanced reporting.\\nA couple of developments have simplified setting up data-ingestion pipelines from\\nREST APIs. First, data providers frequently supply client libraries in various lan‐\\nguages, especially in Python. Client libraries remove much of the boilerplate labor of\\nbuilding API interaction code. Client libraries handle critical details such as authenti‐\\ncation and map fundamental methods into accessible classes.\\nSecond, various services and open source libraries have emerged to interact with\\nAPIs and manage data synchronization.

Platforms also simplify the process of\\nbuilding custom connectors as required.\\nThere are numerous data APIs without client libraries or out-of-the-box connector\\nsupport.

This allows for more flexible and expressive queries than\\nwith REST.

If a message\\nis sent exactly once, then after the subscriber acknowledges the message, the message\\ndisappears and won’t be delivered again.7 Messages sent at least once can be consumed\\nby multiple subscribers or by the same subscriber more than once. This is great when\\nduplications or redundancy don’t matter.\\nIdeally, systems should be idempotent. In an idempotent system, the outcome of\\nprocessing a message once is identical to the outcome of processing it multiple times.\\nThis helps to account for a variety of subtle scenarios. For example, even if our system\\ncan guarantee exactly-once delivery, a consumer might fully process a message but\\nfail right before acknowledging processing. The message will effectively be processed\\ntwice, but an idempotent system handles this scenario gracefully.\\nScalability.    The most popular message queues utilized in event-driven applications\\nare horizontally scalable, running across multiple servers. This allows these queues\\nto scale up and down dynamically, buffer messages when systems fall behind, and\\ndurably store messages for resilience against failure. However, this can create a variety\\nof complications, as mentioned previously (multiple deliveries and fuzzy ordering).\\nEvent-streaming platforms\\nIn some ways, an event-streaming platform is a continuation of a message queue in\\nthat messages are passed from producers to consumers. As discussed previously in\\nthis chapter, the big difference between messages and streams is that a message queue\\nis primarily used to route messages with certain delivery guarantees. In contrast, an\\nevent-streaming platform is used to ingest and process data in an ordered log of\\nSource System Practical Details | 179'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 204, 'page_label': '179'}, page_content='records. In an event-streaming platform, data is retained for a while, and it is possible\\nto replay messages from a past point in time.\\nLet’s describe an event related to an event-streaming platform. As mentioned in\\nChapter 3, an event is “something that happened, typically a change in the  state of\\nsomething. ” An event has the following features: a key, a value, and a timestamp.\\nMultiple key-value timestamps might be contained in a single event. For example, an\\nevent for an ecommerce order might look like this:\\n{\\n  \"Key\":\"Order # 12345\",\\n  \"Value\":\"SKU 123, purchase price of $100\",\\n  \"Timestamp\":\"2023-01-02 06:01:00\"\\n}\\nLet’s look at some of the critical characteristics of an event-streaming platform that\\nyou should be aware of as a data engineer.\\nTopics.    In an event-streaming platform, a producer streams events to a topic, a\\ncollection of related events. A topic might contain fraud alerts, customer orders, or\\ntemperature readings from IoT devices, for example. A topic can have zero, one, or\\nmultiple producers and customers on most event-streaming platforms.\\nUsing the preceding event example, a topic might be web orders. Also, let’s send\\nthis topic to a couple of consumers, such as fulfillment and marketing. This is\\nan excellent example of blurred lines between analytics and an event-driven system.\\nThe fulfillment subscriber will use events to trigger a fulfillment process, while\\nmarketing runs real-time analytics or trains and runs ML models to tune marketing\\ncampaigns (Figure 5-10).\\nFigure 5-10. An order-processing system generates events (small squares) and publishes\\nthem to the web orders topic. Two subscribers—marketing and fulfillment—pull\\nevents from the topic.\\nStream partitions.    Stream partitions  are subdivisions of a stream into multiple\\nstreams. A good analogy is a multilane freeway. Having multiple lanes allows for\\nparallelism and higher throughput. Messages are distributed across partitions by\\npartition key. Messages with the same partition key will always end up in the same\\npartition.\\n180 | Chapter 5: Data Generation in Source Systems'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 205, 'page_label': '180'}, page_content='In Figure 5-11, for example, each message has a numeric ID— shown inside the circle\\nrepresenting the message—that we use as a partition key.

An incoming message stream broken into three partitions\\nSet a partition key so that messages that should be processed together have the same\\npartition key. For example, it is common in IoT settings to want to send all messages\\nfrom a particular device to the same processing server. We can achieve this by using a\\ndevice ID as the partition key, and then setting up one server to consume from each\\npartition.\\nA key concern with stream partitioning is ensuring that your partition key does\\nnot generate hotspotting—a disproportionate number of messages delivered to one\\npartition.

Typically, you’ll deal with two categories of stakeholders:\\nsystems and data stakeholders ( Figure 5-12).

What is a data contract? James Denmore offers this definition:8\\nA data contract is a written agreement between the owner of a source system and the\\nteam ingesting data from that system for use in a data pipeline. The contract should\\nstate what data is being extracted, via what method (full, incremental), how often,\\nas well as who (person, team) are the contacts for both the source system and the\\ningestion. Data contracts should be stored in a well-known and easy-to-find location\\nsuch as a GitHub repo or internal documentation site.

Data storage and query systems generally follow complex recipes involving\\ndistributed systems, numerous services, and multiple hardware storage layers. These\\nsystems require the right raw ingredients to function correctly.\\nLet’s look at some of the raw ingredients of data storage: disk drives, memory,\\nnetworking and CPU, serialization, compression, and caching.\\nMagnetic Disk Drive\\nMagnetic disks utilize spinning platters coated with a ferromagnetic film ( Figure 6-3).\\nThis film is magnetized by a read/write head during write operations to physically\\nencode binary data. The read/write head detects the magnetic field and outputs a bit‐\\nstream during read operations. Magnetic disk drives have been around for ages. They\\nstill form the backbone of bulk data storage systems because they are significantly\\ncheaper than SSDs per gigabyte of stored data.\\nOn the one hand, these disks have seen extraordinary improvements in perfor‐\\nmance, storage density, and cost. 1 On the other hand, SSDs dramatically outperform\\nmagnetic disks on various metrics.

Magnetic disk head movement and rotation are essential in random access\\nlatency\\nIBM developed magnetic disk drive technology in the 1950s. Since then, magnetic\\ndisk capacities have grown steadily. The first commercial magnetic disk drive, the\\nIBM 350, had a capacity of 3.75 megabytes. As of this writing, magnetic drives\\nstoring 20 TB are commercially available. In fact, magnetic disks continue to see\\nrapid innovation, with methods such as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR),\\nshingled magnetic recording (SMR), and helium-filled disk enclosures being used\\nto realize ever greater storage densities. In spite of the continuing improvements in\\ndrive capacity, other aspects of HDD performance are hampered by physics.\\nFirst, disk transfer speed , the rate at which data can be read and written, does not\\nscale in proportion with disk capacity. Disk capacity scales with areal density (gigabits\\nstored per square inch), whereas transfer speed scales with  linear density (bits per\\ninch). This means that if disk capacity grows by a factor of 4, transfer speed increases\\nby only a factor of 2. Consequently, current data center drives support maximum\\ndata transfer speeds of 200–300 MB/s. To frame this another way, it takes more than\\n20 hours to read the entire contents of a 30 TB magnetic drive, assuming a transfer\\nspeed of 300 MB/s.\\nA second major limitation is seek time. To access data, the drive must physically\\nrelocate the read/write heads to the appropriate track on the disk. Third, in order\\nto find a particular piece of data on the disk, the disk controller must wait for that\\ndata to rotate under the read/write heads. This leads to rotational latency.

A fourth limitation is input/output operations per\\nsecond (IOPS), critical for transactional databases. A magnetic drive ranges from 50\\nto 500 IOPS.\\nVarious tricks can improve latency and transfer speed. Using a higher rotational\\nspeed can increase transfer rate and decrease rotational latency. Limiting the radius\\nof the disk platter or writing data into only a narrow band on the disk reduces seek\\ntime. However, none of these techniques makes magnetic drives remotely competitive\\nwith SSDs for random access lookups. SSDs can deliver data with significantly lower\\nlatency, higher IOPS, and higher transfer speeds, partially because there is no physi‐\\ncally rotating disk or magnetic head to wait for.\\nAs mentioned earlier, magnetic disks are still prized in data centers for their low data-\\nstorage costs. In addition, magnetic drives can sustain extraordinarily high transfer\\nrates through parallelism. This is the critical idea behind cloud object storage: data\\ncan be distributed across thousands of disks in clusters. Data-transfer rates go up\\ndramatically by reading from numerous disks simultaneously, limited primarily by\\nnetwork performance rather than disk transfer rate. Thus, network components and\\nCPUs are also key raw ingredients in storage systems, and we will return to these\\ntopics shortly.\\nSolid-State Drive\\nSolid-state drives (SSDs) store data as charges in flash memory cells. SSDs eliminate\\nthe mechanical components of magnetic drives; the data is read by purely electronic\\nmeans. SSDs can look up random data in less than 0.1 ms (100 microseconds).

SSDs allow relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL\\nServer to handle thousands of transactions per second.\\nHowever, SSDs are not currently the default option for high-scale analytics data\\nstorage. Again, this comes down to cost. Commercial SSDs typically cost 20–30 cents\\n(USD) per gigabyte of capacity, nearly 10 times the cost per capacity of a magnetic\\ndrive.

Data stored in system memory by software is generally\\nnot in a format suitable for storage on disk or transmission over a network. Serializa‐\\ntion is the process of flattening and packing data into a standard format that a reader\\nwill be able to decode. Serialization formats provide a standard of data exchange. We\\nmight encode data in a row-based manner as an XML, JSON, or CSV file and pass\\nit to another user who can then decode it using a standard library. A serialization\\nalgorithm has logic for handling types, imposes rules on data structure, and allows\\nexchange between programming languages and CPUs. The serialization algorithm\\nalso has rules for handling exceptions. For instance, Python objects can contain cyclic\\nreferences; the serialization algorithm might throw an error or limit nesting depth on\\nencountering a cycle.\\nLow-level database storage is also a form of serialization. Row-oriented relational\\ndatabases organize data as rows on disk to support speedy lookups and in-place\\nupdates. Columnar databases organize data into column files to optimize for highly\\nefficient compression and support fast scans of large data volumes. Each serialization\\nchoice comes with a set of trade-offs, and data engineers tune these choices to\\noptimize performance to requirements.\\nWe provide a more detailed catalog of common data serialization techniques and for‐\\nmats in Appendix A. We suggest that data engineers become familiar with common\\nserialization practices and formats, especially the most popular current formats (e.g.,\\nApache Parquet), hybrid serialization (e.g., Apache Hudi), and in-memory serializa‐\\ntion (e.g., Apache Arrow).\\nCompression\\nCompression is another critical component of storage engineering. On a basic level,\\ncompression makes data smaller, but compression algorithms interact with other\\ndetails of storage systems in complex ways.\\nHighly efficient compression has three main advantages in storage systems. First,\\nthe data is smaller and thus takes up less space on the disk. Second, compression\\nincreases the practical scan speed per disk. With a 10:1 compression ratio, we go from\\nscanning 200 MB/s per magnetic disk to an effective rate of 2 GB/s per disk.\\nThe third advantage is in network performance. Given that a network connection\\nbetween an Amazon EC2 instance and S3 provides 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) of\\nbandwidth, a 10:1 compression ratio increases effective network bandwidth to 100\\nGbps.\\n196 | Chapter 6: Storage'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 221, 'page_label': '196'}, page_content='Compression also comes with disadvantages.

We will\\nforward-reference the object storage discussion extensively over the next few pages.\\nFile storage systems organize files into a directory tree. The directory reference for a\\nfile might look like this:\\n/Users/matthewhousley/output.txt\\nWhen this file reference is passed to the operating system, it starts at the root\\ndirectory /, finds Users, matthewhousley, and finally output.txt. Working from\\nthe left, each directory is contained inside a parent directory, until we finally reach\\nthe file output.txt. This example uses Unix semantics, but Windows file reference\\nsemantics are similar. The filesystem stores each directory as metadata about the files\\nand directories that it contains. This metadata consists of the name of each entity,\\nrelevant permission details, and a pointer to the actual entity. To find a file on disk,\\nthe operating system looks at the metadata at each hierarchy level and follows the\\npointer to the next subdirectory entity until finally reaching the file itself.\\nNote that other file-like data entities generally don’t necessarily have all these proper‐\\nties. For example, objects in object storage support only the first characteristic, finite\\nlength, but are still extremely useful. We discuss this in “Object Storage” on page 205.\\nIn cases where file storage paradigms are necessary for a pipeline, be careful with\\nstate and try to use ephemeral environments as much as possible. Even if you must\\nprocess files on a server with an attached disk, use object storage for intermediate\\nstorage between processing steps. Try to reserve manual, low-level file processing for\\none-time ingestion steps or the exploratory stages of pipeline development.\\nLocal disk storage\\nThe most familiar type of file storage is an operating system–managed filesystem\\non a local disk partition of SSD or magnetic disk. New Technology File System\\n(NTFS) and ext4 are popular filesystems on Windows and Linux, respectively. The\\noperating system handles the details of storing directory entities, files, and metadata.\\nFilesystems are designed to write data to allow for easy recovery in the event of power\\nloss during a write, though any unwritten data will still be lost.\\n200 | Chapter 6: Storage'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 225, 'page_label': '200'}, page_content='Local filesystems generally support full read after write consistency; reading immedi‐\\nately after a write will return the written data.

In the cloud, virtualized block storage is the standard for VMs. These\\nblock storage abstractions allow fine control of storage size, scalability, and data\\ndurability beyond that offered by raw disks.\\nIn our earlier discussion of SSDs and magnetic disks, we mentioned that with these\\nrandom-access devices, the operating system can seek, read, and write any data\\non the disk. A block is the smallest addressable unit of data supported by a disk.\\nThis was often 512 bytes of usable data on older disks, but it has now grown to\\n4,096 bytes for most current disks, making writes less fine-grained but dramatically\\nreducing the overhead of managing blocks. Blocks typically contain extra bits for\\nerror detection/correction and other metadata.\\nBlocks on magnetic disks are geometrically arranged on a physical platter. Two blocks\\non the same track can be read without moving the head, while reading two blocks on\\nseparate tracks requires a seek. Seek time can occur between blocks on an SSD, but\\nthis is infinitesimal compared to the seek time for magnetic disk tracks.\\nBlock storage applications\\nTransactional database systems generally access disks at a block level to lay out\\ndata for optimal performance. For row-oriented databases, this originally meant that\\nrows of data were written as continuous streams; the situation has grown more\\ncomplicated with the arrival of SSDs and their associated seek-time performance\\nimprovements, but transactional databases still rely on the high random access per‐\\nformance offered by direct access to a block storage device.\\nBlock storage also remains the default option for operating system boot disks on\\ncloud VMs. The block device is formatted much as it would be directly on a physical\\ndisk, but the storage is usually virtualized.

RAID\\nsimultaneously controls multiple disks to improve data durability, enhance perfor‐\\nmance, and combine capacity from multiple drives.

We lose much of the\\nwriting flexibility we expect with file storage on a local disk in an object store. Objects\\ndon’t support random writes or append operations; instead, they are written once as a\\nstream of bytes. After this initial write, objects become immutable. To change data in\\nan object or append data to it, we must rewrite the full object. Object stores generally\\nsupport random reads through range requests, but these lookups may perform much\\nworse than random reads from data stored on an SSD.\\nFor a software developer used to leveraging local random access file storage, the\\ncharacteristics of objects might seem like constraints, but less is more; object stores\\ndon’t need to support locks or change synchronization, allowing data storage across\\nmassive disk clusters. Object stores support extremely performant parallel stream\\nwrites and reads across many disks, and this parallelism is hidden from engineers,\\nwho can simply deal with the stream rather than communicating with individual\\ndisks. In a cloud environment, write speed scales with the number of streams being\\nwritten up to quota limits set by the vendor.

The consistency issue\\nstill exists when a client requests the “default” or “latest” version of an object.\\nThe principal overhead that engineers need to consider with object versioning is\\nthe cost of storage. Historical versions of objects generally have the same associated\\nstorage costs as current versions. Object version costs may be nearly insignificant or\\ncatastrophically expensive, depending on various factors. The data size is an issue, as\\nis update frequency; more object versions can lead to significantly larger data size.\\nKeep in mind that we’re talking about brute-force object versioning.

We use the term reduced access\\nhere because many of these storage tiers still make data highly available, but with high\\nretrieval costs in exchange for reduced storage costs.\\nLet’s look at a couple of examples in S3 since Amazon is a benchmark for cloud ser‐\\nvice standards. The S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class discounts monthly\\nstorage costs for increased data retrieval costs. (See “ A Brief Detour on Cloud\\nEconomics” on page 125 for a theoretical discussion of the economics of cloud\\nstorage tiers.) Amazon also offers the Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access tier,\\nreplicating only to a single zone.

Users have various retrieval speed options, from minutes to hours, with\\nhigher retrieval costs for faster access.

However, traditional RAM is extremely vulnerable to\\ndata loss because a power outage lasting even a second can erase data. RAM-based\\nstorage systems are generally focused on caching applications, presenting data for\\nquick access and high bandwidth. Data should generally be written to a more durable\\nmedium for retention purposes.\\nThese ultra-fast cache systems are useful when data engineers need to serve data with\\nultra-fast retrieval latency.\\nExample: Memcached and lightweight object caching\\nMemcached is a key-value store designed for caching database query results, API\\ncall responses, and more. Memcached uses simple data structures, supporting either\\nstring or integer types. Memcached can deliver results with very low latency while\\nalso taking the load off backend systems.\\nExample: Redis, memory caching with optional persistence\\nLike Memcached, Redis is a key-value store, but it supports somewhat more com‐\\nplex data types (such as lists or sets).

Redis is thus suitable for extremely\\nhigh-performance applications but can tolerate a small amount of data loss.\\nThe Hadoop Distributed File System\\nIn the recent past, “Hadoop” was virtually synonymous with “big data. ” The  Hadoop\\nDistributed File System is based on Google File System (GFS)  and was initially\\nengineered to process data with the MapReduce programming model . Hadoop is\\nsimilar to object storage but with a key difference: Hadoop combines compute and\\nstorage on the same nodes, where object stores typically have limited support for\\ninternal processing.\\nHadoop breaks large files into blocks, chunks of data less than a few hundred\\nmegabytes in size. The filesystem is managed by the NameNode, which maintains\\ndirectories, file metadata, and a detailed catalog describing the location of file blocks\\nin the cluster. In a typical configuration, each block of data is replicated to three\\nnodes. This increases both the durability and availability of data.

Hadoop combines compute resources with\\nstorage nodes to allow in-place data processing. This was originally achieved using\\nthe MapReduce programming model, which we discuss in Chapter 8.\\nHadoop is dead. Long live Hadoop!\\nWe often see claims that Hadoop is dead. This is only partially true. Hadoop is\\nno longer a hot, bleeding-edge technology. Many Hadoop ecosystem tools such as\\nApache Pig are now on life support and primarily used to run legacy jobs. The pure\\nMapReduce programming model has fallen by the wayside. HDFS remains widely\\nused in various applications and organizations.\\nHadoop still appears in many legacy installations. Many organizations that adopted\\nHadoop during the peak of the big data craze have no immediate plans to migrate to\\nnewer technologies. This is a good choice for companies that run massive (thousand-\\nnode) Hadoop clusters and have the resources to maintain on-premises systems\\neffectively. Smaller companies may want to reconsider the cost overhead and scale\\nlimitations of running a small Hadoop cluster against migrating to cloud solutions.\\nIn addition, HDFS is a key ingredient of many current big data engines, such as\\nAmazon EMR. In fact, Apache Spark is still commonly run on HDFS clusters. We\\ndiscuss this in more detail in “Separation of Compute from Storage” on page 220.\\nStreaming Storage\\nStreaming data has different storage requirements than nonstreaming data. In the\\ncase of message queues, stored data is temporal and expected to disappear after a\\ncertain duration. However, distributed, scalable streaming frameworks like Apache\\nKafka now allow extremely long-duration streaming data retention. Kafka supports\\nindefinite data retention by pushing old, infrequently accessed messages down to\\nobject storage. Kafka competitors (including Amazon Kinesis, Apache Pulsar, and\\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub) also support long data retention.\\nClosely related to data retention in these systems is the notion of replay. Replay\\nallows a streaming system to return a range of historical stored data. Replay is the\\nstandard data-retrieval mechanism for streaming storage systems. Replay can be used\\nto run batch queries over a time range or to reprocess data in a streaming pipeline.\\nChapter 7 covers replay in more depth.\\nOther storage engines have emerged for real-time analytics applications.

Without indexes, a database would need to scan an\\nentire table to find the records satisfying a WHERE condition.\\nIn most RDBMSs, indexes are used for primary table keys (allowing unique identifi‐\\ncation of rows) and foreign keys (allowing joins with other tables).

In addition to scanning only data in\\ncolumns relevant to a query, we can partition a table into multiple subtables by\\nsplitting it on a field. It is quite common in analytics and data science use cases to\\nscan over a time range, so date- and time-based partitioning is extremely common.\\nColumnar databases generally support a variety of other partition schemes as well.\\nClusters allow finer-grained organization of data within partitions. A clustering\\nscheme applied within a columnar database sorts data by one or a few fields, colocat‐\\ning similar values. This improves performance for filtering, sorting, and joining these\\nvalues.\\nExample: Snowflake micro-partitioning\\nWe mention Snowflake micro-partitioning because it’s a good example of recent\\ndevelopments and evolution in approaches to columnar storage. Micro partitions are\\nsets of rows between 50 and 500 megabytes in uncompressed size. Snowflake uses an\\nalgorithmic approach that attempts to cluster together similar rows. This contrasts\\nthe traditional naive approach to partitioning on a single designated field, such as a\\ndate. Snowflake specifically looks for values that are repeated in a field across many\\nrows. This allows aggressive pruning of queries based on predicates. For example, a\\nWHERE clause might stipulate the following:\\nWHERE created_date='2022-01-02'\\nIn such a query, Snowflake excludes any micro-partitions that don’t include this date,\\neffectively pruning this data. Snowflake also allows overlapping micro-partitions,\\npotentially partitioning on multiple fields showing significant repeats.\\nEfficient pruning is facilitated by Snowflake’s metadata database, which stores a\\ndescription of each micro-partition, including the number of rows and value ranges\\nfor fields. At each query stage, Snowflake analyzes micro-partitions to determine\\nwhich ones need to be scanned. Snowflake uses the term hybrid columnar storage,2\\npartially referring to the fact that its tables are broken into small groups of rows, even\\nthough storage is fundamentally columnar.

Data catalogs streamline cross-\\norganizational communications and collaboration.\\nData Sharing\\nData sharing allows organizations and individuals to share specific data and carefully\\ndefined permissions with specific entities. Data sharing allows data scientists to\\nshare data from a sandbox with their collaborators within an organization. Across\\norganizations, data sharing facilitates collaboration between partner businesses.

What data types are expected? How does the data\\nfit into a larger hierarchy? Is it connected to other data through shared keys or other\\nrelationships?\\nNote that schema need not be relational.

For images stored in\\na data lake, this schema information might explain the image format, resolution, and\\nthe way the images fit into a larger hierarchy.\\nSchema can function as a sort of Rosetta stone, instructions that tell us how to read\\nthe data. Two major schema patterns exist: schema on write and schema on read.\\nSchema on write  is essentially the traditional data warehouse pattern: a table has an\\nintegrated schema; any writes to the table must conform.

This comes at the cost of greater\\ndifficulty consuming data in the future.\\nSeparation of Compute from Storage\\nA key idea we revisit throughout this book is the separation of compute from storage.\\nThis has emerged as a standard data access and query pattern in today’s cloud era.\\nData lakes, as we discussed, store data in object stores and spin up temporary com‐\\npute capacity to read and process it. Most fully managed OLAP products now rely\\non object storage behind the scenes. To understand the motivations for separating\\ncompute and storage, we should first look at the colocation of compute and storage.\\nColocation of compute and storage\\nColocation of compute and storage has long been a standard method to improve\\ndatabase performance. For transactional databases, data colocation allows fast, low-\\nlatency disk reads and high bandwidth. Even when we virtualize storage (e.g., using\\nAmazon EBS), data is located relatively close to the host machine.\\nThe same basic idea applies for analytics query systems running across a cluster of\\nmachines. For example, with HDFS and MapReduce, the standard approach is to\\nlocate data blocks that need to be scanned in the cluster, and then push individual\\nmap jobs out to these blocks. The data scan and processing for the map step are\\nstrictly local. The reduce step involves shuffling data across the cluster, but keeping\\nmap steps local effectively preserves more bandwidth for shuffling, delivering better\\noverall performance; map steps that filter heavily also dramatically reduce the amount\\nof data to be shuffled.\\nSeparation of compute and storage\\nIf colocation of compute and storage delivers high performance, why the shift toward\\nseparation of compute and storage? Several motivations exist.\\nEphemerality and scalability.    In the cloud, we’ve seen a dramatic shift toward ephemer‐\\nality. In general, it’s cheaper to buy and host a server than to rent it from a cloud\\nprovider, provided that you’re running it 24 hours a day nonstop for years on end . In\\npractice, workloads vary dramatically, and significant efficiencies are realized with a\\npay-as-you-go model if servers can scale up and down. This is true for web servers in\\nonline retail, and it is also true for big data batch jobs that may run only periodically.\\n220 | Chapter 6: Storage'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 245, 'page_label': '220'}, page_content='Ephemeral compute resources allow engineers to spin up massive clusters to com‐\\nplete jobs on time and then delete clusters when these jobs are done. The per‐\\nformance benefits of temporarily operating at ultra-high scale can outweigh the\\nbandwidth limitations of object storage.\\nData durability and availability.    Cloud object stores significantly mitigate the risk of\\ndata loss and generally provide extremely high uptime (availability). For example, S3\\nstores data across multiple zones; if a natural disaster destroys a zone, data is still\\navailable from the remaining zones. Having multiple zones available also reduces the\\nodds of a data outage. If resources in one zone go down, engineers can spin up the\\nsame resources in a different zone.\\nThe potential for a misconfiguration that destroys data in object storage is still some‐\\nwhat scary, but simple-to-deploy mitigations are available. Copying data to multiple\\ncloud regions reduces this risk since configuration changes are generally deployed to\\nonly one region at a time. Replicating data to multiple storage providers can further\\nreduce the risk.\\nHybrid separation and colocation\\nThe practical realities of separating compute from storage are more complicated\\nthan we’ve implied. In practice, we constantly hybridize colocation and separation to\\nrealize the benefits of both approaches. This hybridization is typically done in two\\nways: multitier caching and hybrid object storage.\\nWith multitier caching, we utilize object storage for long-term data retention and\\naccess but spin up local storage to be used during queries and various stages of data\\npipelines. Both Google and Amazon offer versions of hybrid object storage (object\\nstorage that is tightly integrated with compute).\\nLet’s look at examples of how some popular processing engines hybridize separation\\nand colocation of storage and compute.\\nExample: AWS EMR with S3 and HDFS.    Big data services like Amazon EMR spin up tem‐\\nporary HDFS clusters to process data. Engineers have the option of referencing both\\nS3 and HDFS as a filesystem. A common pattern is to stand up HDFS on SSD drives,\\npull from S3, and save data from intermediate processing steps on local HDFS. Doing\\nso can realize significant performance gains over processing directly from S3. Full\\nresults are written back to S3 once the cluster completes its steps, and the cluster and\\nHDFS are deleted. Other consumers read the output data directly from S3.\\nExample: Apache Spark.    In practice, Spark generally runs jobs on HDFS or some other\\nephemeral distributed filesystem to support performant storage of data between\\nprocessing steps. In addition, Spark relies heavily on in-memory storage of data to\\nimprove processing.

Apache Druid relies heavily on SSDs to realize high perfor‐\\nmance. Since SSDs are significantly more expensive than magnetic disks, Druid keeps\\nonly one copy of data in its cluster, reducing “live” storage costs by a factor of three.\\nOf course, maintaining data durability is still critical, so Druid uses an object store as\\nits durability layer. When data is ingested, it’s processed, serialized into compressed\\ncolumns, and written to cluster SSDs and object storage. In the event of node failure\\nor cluster data corruption, data can be automatically recovered to new nodes. In\\naddition, the cluster can be shut down and then fully recovered from SSD storage.\\nExample: Hybrid object storage.    Google’s Colossus file storage system  supports fine-\\ngrained control of data block location, although this functionality is not exposed\\ndirectly to the public. BigQuery uses this feature to colocate customer tables in a\\nsingle location, allowing ultra-high bandwidth for queries in that location. 4 We refer\\nto this as hybrid object storage  because it combines the clean abstractions of object\\nstorage with some advantages of colocating compute and storage. Amazon also offers\\nsome notion of hybrid object storage through S3 Select, a feature that allows users to\\nfilter S3 data directly in S3 clusters before data is returned across the network.\\nWe speculate that public clouds will adopt hybrid object storage more widely to\\nimprove the performance of their offerings and make more efficient use of available\\nnetwork resources. Some may be already doing so without disclosing this publicly.\\nThe concept of hybrid object storage underscores that there can still be advantages\\nto having low-level access to hardware rather than relying on someone else’s public\\ncloud.

This\\ntypically means that a new virtual copy of an object is created (e.g., a new table)\\nwithout necessarily physically copying the underlying data.

Y ou need to think about the data storage lifecycle and data retention. When\\nyou think about access frequency and use cases, ask, “How important is the data to\\ndownstream users, and how often do they need to access it?” This is the data storage\\nlifecycle. Another question you should ask is, “How long should I keep this data?” Do\\nyou need to retain data indefinitely, or are you fine discarding it past a certain time\\nframe? This is data retention. Let’s dive into each of these.\\nHot, warm, and cold data\\nDid you know that data has a temperature? Depending on how frequently data is\\naccessed, we can roughly bucket the way it is stored into three categories of persis‐\\ntence: hot, warm, and cold. Query access patterns differ for each dataset ( Figure 6-9).\\nTypically, newer data is queried more often than older data.

The underlying\\nstorage for hot data is suited for fast access and reads, such as SSD or memory.\\nBecause of the type of hardware involved with hot data, storing hot data is often the\\nmost expensive form of storage. Example use cases for hot data include retrieving\\nproduct recommendations and product page results. The cost of storing hot data is\\nthe highest of these three storage tiers, but retrieval is often inexpensive.\\nQuery results cache is another example of hot data. When a query is run, some\\nquery engines will persist the query results in the cache. For a limited time, when the\\nsame query is run, instead of rerunning the same query against storage, the query\\nresults cache serves the cached results. This allows for much faster query response\\ntimes versus redundantly issuing the same query repeatedly. In upcoming chapters,\\nwe cover query results caches in more detail.\\nWarm data.    Warm data is accessed semi-regularly, say, once per month. No hard\\nand fast rules indicate how often warm data is accessed, but it’s less than hot data\\nand more than cold data. The major cloud providers offer object storage tiers that\\naccommodate warm data. For example, S3 offers an Infrequently Accessed Tier, and\\nGoogle Cloud has a similar storage tier called Nearline. Vendors give their models\\nof recommended access frequency, and engineers can also do their cost modeling\\nand monitoring. Storage of warm data is cheaper than hot data, with slightly more\\nexpensive retrieval costs.\\nCold data.    On the other extreme, cold data is infrequently accessed data.

If you’re in the cloud and using\\nmanaged services, disk spillover will happen automatically.\\nIf you’re using cloud-based object storage, create automated lifecycle policies for your\\ndata. This will drastically reduce your storage costs. For example, if your data needs\\nto be accessed only once a month, move the data to an infrequent access storage\\ntier. If your data is 180 days old and not accessed for current queries, move it to\\nan archival storage tier. In both cases, you can automate the migration of data away\\nfrom regular object storage, and you’ll save money.

A multitenant architecture\\ninverts this and shares these resources among groups of users. Both architectures are\\nwidely used. This section looks at the implications of single-tenant and multitenant\\nstorage.\\nAdopting single-tenant storage means that every tenant gets their dedicated storage.\\nIn the example in Figure 6-10, each tenant gets a database. No data is shared among\\nthese databases, and storage is totally isolated.

Robust security at rest and in motion\\nwith fine-grained data access control allows data to be shared and consumed more\\nwidely within a business. The value of data goes up significantly when this is possible.\\nAs always, exercise the principle of least privilege. Don’t give full database access\\nto anyone unless required. This means most data engineers don’t need full database\\naccess in practice. Also, pay attention to the column, row, and cell-level access con‐\\ntrols in your database. Give users only the information they need and no more.\\nData Management\\nData management is critical as we read and write data with storage systems.\\nData catalogs and metadata management\\nData is enhanced by robust metadata. Cataloging enables data scientists, analysts,\\nand ML engineers by enabling data discovery. Data lineage accelerates the time to\\ntrack down data problems and allows consumers to locate upstream raw sources.\\nAs you build out your storage systems, invest in your metadata. Integration of a\\ndata dictionary with these other tools allows users to share and record institutional\\nknowledge robustly.\\n228 | Chapter 6: Storage'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 253, 'page_label': '228'}, page_content='Metadata management also significantly enhances data governance.

Data versioning can help\\nwith error recovery when processes fail, and data becomes corrupted. Versioning\\nis also beneficial for tracking the history of datasets used to build models. Just as\\ncode version control allows developers to track down commits that cause bugs,\\ndata version control can aid ML engineers in tracking changes that lead to model\\nperformance degradation.\\nPrivacy\\nGDPR and other privacy regulations have significantly impacted storage system\\ndesign. Any data with privacy implications has a lifecycle that data engineers must\\nmanage. Data engineers must be prepared to respond to data deletion requests and\\nselectively remove data as required. In addition, engineers can accommodate privacy\\nand security through anonymization and masking.\\nDataOps\\nDataOps is not orthogonal to data management, and a significant area of overlap\\nexists. DataOps concerns itself with traditional operational monitoring of storage\\nsystems and monitoring the data itself, inseparable from metadata and quality.\\nSystems monitoring\\nData engineers must monitor storage in a variety of ways. This includes monitoring\\ninfrastructure storage components, where they exist, but also monitoring object\\nstorage and other “serverless” systems. Data engineers should take the lead on FinOps\\n(cost management), security monitoring, and access monitoring.\\nObserving and monitoring data\\nWhile metadata systems as we’ve described are critical, good engineering must con‐\\nsider the entropic nature of data by actively seeking to understand its characteristics\\nand watching for major changes. Engineers can monitor data statistics, apply anom‐\\naly detection methods or simple rules, and actively test and validate for logical\\ninconsistencies.\\nUndercurrents | 229'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 254, 'page_label': '229'}, page_content='Data Architecture\\nChapter 3 covers the basics of data architecture, as storage is the critical underbelly of\\nthe data engineering lifecycle.\\nConsider the following data architecture tips.

Data from system 1 is ingested into system 2\\nIt’s worth quickly contrasting data ingestion with data integration. Whereas data\\ningestion is data movement from point A to B, data integration combines data from\\ndisparate sources into a new dataset. For example, you can use data integration to\\ncombine data from a CRM system, advertising analytics data, and web analytics to\\ncreate a user profile, which is saved to your data warehouse. Furthermore, using\\nreverse ETL, you can send this newly created user profile back to your CRM so\\nsalespeople can use the data for prioritizing leads. We describe data integration more\\nfully in Chapter 8, where we discuss data transformations; reverse ETL is covered in\\nChapter 9.\\nWe also point out that data ingestion is different from internal ingestion within a\\nsystem. Data stored in a database is copied from one table to another, or data in\\na stream is temporarily cached. We consider this another part of the general data\\ntransformation process covered in Chapter 8.\\nData Pipelines Defined\\nData pipelines begin in source systems, but ingestion is the stage where data engi‐\\nneers begin actively designing data pipeline activities.

It is essential\\nto understand the details of these various patterns and know that a modern data\\npipeline includes all of them. As the world moves away from a traditional monolithic\\napproach with rigid constraints on data movement, and toward an open ecosystem of\\ncloud services that are assembled like LEGO bricks to realize products, data engineers\\nprioritize using the right tools to accomplish the desired outcome over adhering to a\\nnarrow philosophy of data movement.\\nIn general, here’s our definition of a data pipeline:\\n234 | Chapter 7: Ingestion'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 259, 'page_label': '234'}, page_content='A data pipeline is the combination of architecture, systems, and processes that move\\ndata through the stages of the data engineering lifecycle.\\nOur definition is deliberately fluid—and intentionally vague—to allow data engineers\\nto plug in whatever they need to accomplish the task at hand.

Ingestion processes can be batch,\\nmicro-batch, or real-time.\\nIngestion frequencies vary dramatically from slow to fast ( Figure 7-4). On the slow\\nend, a business might ship its tax data to an accounting firm once a year. On the\\nfaster side, a CDC system could retrieve new log updates from a source database once\\na minute.

Reliability and durability\\nhave both direct and indirect costs. For example, will your ingestion process continue\\nif an AWS zone goes down? How about a whole region? How about the power grid\\nor the internet? Of course, nothing is free. How much will this cost you? Y ou might\\nbe able to build a highly redundant system and have a team on call 24 hours a day\\nto handle outages. This also means your cloud and labor costs become prohibitive\\n(direct costs), and the ongoing work takes a significant toll on your team (indirect\\ncosts). There’s no single correct answer, and you need to evaluate the costs and\\nbenefits of your reliability and durability decisions.\\nDon’t assume that you can build a system that will reliably and durably ingest data in\\nevery possible scenario. Even the nearly infinite budget of the US federal government\\ncan’t guarantee this. In many extreme scenarios, ingesting data actually won’t matter.\\nThere will be little to ingest if the internet goes down, even if you build multiple air-\\ngapped data centers in underground bunkers with independent power.

Kind consists of type and format. Data has a type—tabular,\\nimage, video, text, etc. The type directly influences the data format or the way it\\nis expressed in bytes, names, and file extensions. For example, a tabular kind of\\ndata may be in formats such as CSV or Parquet, with each of these formats having\\ndifferent byte patterns for serialization and deserialization. Another kind of data is an\\nimage, which has a format of JPG or PNG and is inherently unstructured.\\nShape\\nEvery payload has a shape that describes its dimensions.

The smaller\\nchunked files are sent to their destination and then reassembled after all data has\\narrived.\\nSchema and data types\\nMany data payloads have a schema, such as tabular and semistructured data. As\\nmentioned earlier in this book, a schema describes the fields and types of data\\nwithin those fields. Other data, such as unstructured text, images, and audio, will not\\nhave an explicit schema or data types. However, they might come with technical file\\ndescriptions on shape, data and file format, encoding, size, etc.\\nAlthough you can connect to databases in various ways (such as file export, CDC,\\nJDBC/ODBC), the connection is easy. The great engineering challenge is understand‐\\ning the underlying schema. Applications organize data in various ways, and engineers\\nneed to be intimately familiar with the organization of the data and relevant update\\npatterns to make sense of it. The problem has been somewhat exacerbated by the\\npopularity of object-relational mapping (ORM), which automatically generates sche‐\\nmas based on object structure in languages such as Java or Python. Natural structures\\nin an object-oriented language often map to something messy in an operational\\ndatabase. Data engineers may need to familiarize themselves with the class structure\\nof application code.\\nSchema is not only for databases. As we’ve discussed, APIs present their schema\\ncomplications. Many vendor APIs have friendly reporting methods that prepare data\\nfor analytics. In other cases, engineers are not so lucky. The API is a thin wrapper\\naround underlying systems, requiring engineers to understand application internals\\nto use the data.\\nMuch of the work associated with ingesting from source schemas happens in the\\ndata engineering lifecycle transformation stage, which we discuss in Chapter 8. We’ve\\nplaced this discussion here because data engineers need to begin studying source\\nschemas as soon they plan to ingest data from a new source.\\nCommunication is critical for understanding source data, and engineers also have\\nthe opportunity to reverse the flow of communication and help software engineers\\nimprove data where it is produced.

This section covers issues you should consider when\\ningesting events, drawing on topics covered in Chapters 5 and 6.\\nSchema Evolution\\nSchema evolution is common when handling event data; fields may be added or\\nremoved, or value types might change (say, a string to an integer). Schema evolution\\ncan have unintended impacts on your data pipelines and destinations. For example,\\nan IoT device gets a firmware update that adds a new field to the event it transmits,\\nor a third-party API introduces changes to its event payload or countless other\\nscenarios. All of these potentially impact your downstream capabilities.\\nTo alleviate issues related to schema evolution, here are a few suggestions. First, if\\nyour event-processing framework has a schema registry (discussed earlier in this\\nchapter), use it to version your schema changes. Next, a dead-letter queue (described\\nin “Error Handling and Dead-Letter Queues” on page 249) can help you investigate\\nissues with events that are not properly handled. Finally, the low-fidelity route\\n(and the most effective) is regularly communicating with upstream stakeholders\\nabout potential schema changes and proactively addressing schema changes with the\\nteams introducing these changes instead of reacting to the receiving end of breaking\\nchanges.\\nLate-Arriving Data\\nThough you probably prefer all event data to arrive on time, event data might arrive\\nlate. A group of events might occur around the same time frame (similar event\\ntimes), but some might arrive later than others (late ingestion times) because of\\nvarious circumstances.\\nFor example, an IoT device might be late sending a message because of internet\\nlatency issues. This is common when ingesting data. Y ou should be aware of late-\\narriving data and the impact on downstream systems and uses. Suppose you assume\\nthat ingestion or process time is the same as the event time. Y ou may get some\\nstrange results if your reports or analysis depend on an accurate portrayal of when\\nevents occur.

Amazon Kinesis\\nsupports a maximum message size of 1 MB. Kafka defaults to this maximum size but\\ncan be configured for a maximum of 20 MB or more. (Configurability may vary on\\nmanaged service platforms.)\\nError Handling and Dead-Letter Queues\\nSometimes events aren’t successfully ingested. Perhaps an event is sent to a nonexis‐\\ntent topic or message queue, the message size may be too large, or the event has\\nexpired past its TTL.

The data‐\\nbase returns query results over the wire, where the driver receives them and translates\\nthem back into a standard form to be read by the client. For ingestion, the application\\nutilizing the ODBC driver is an ingestion tool. The ingestion tool may pull data\\nthrough many small queries or a single large query.\\nJDBC is conceptually remarkably similar to ODBC. A Java driver connects to a\\nremote database and serves as a translation layer between the standard JDBC API\\nand the native network interface of the target database. It might seem strange to\\nhave a database API dedicated to a single programming language, but there are\\nstrong motivations for this. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is standard, portable\\nacross hardware architectures and operating systems, and provides the performance\\nof compiled code through a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. The JVM is an extremely\\npopular compiling VM for running code in a portable manner.\\nJDBC provides extraordinary database driver portability. ODBC drivers are shipped\\nas OS and architecture native binaries; database vendors must maintain versions for\\neach architecture/OS version that they wish to support. On the other hand, vendors\\ncan ship a single JDBC driver that is compatible with any JVM language (e.g., Java,\\nScala, Clojure, or Kotlin) and JVM data framework (i.e., Spark.) JDBC has become so\\npopular that it is also used as an interface for non-JVM languages such as Python; the\\nPython ecosystem provides translation tools that allow Python code to talk to a JDBC\\ndriver running on a local JVM.\\nJDBC and ODBC are used extensively for data ingestion from relational databases,\\nreturning to the general concept of direct database connections. Various enhance‐\\nments are used to accelerate data ingestion. Many data frameworks can parallelize\\nseveral simultaneous connections and partition queries to pull data in parallel. On the\\nother hand, nothing is free; using parallel connections also increases the load on the\\nsource database.\\nJDBC and ODBC were long the gold standards for data ingestion from databases, but\\nthese connection standards are beginning to show their age for many data engineer‐\\ning applications. These connection standards struggle with nested data, and they send\\ndata as rows.

Alternatively, many cloud data warehouses\\nprovide direct REST APIs.\\nJDBC connections should generally be integrated with other ingestion technologies.\\nFor example, we commonly use a reader process to connect to a database with JDBC,\\nwrite the extracted data into multiple objects, and then orchestrate ingestion into\\na downstream system (see Figure 7-13 ). The reader process can run in a wholly\\nephemeral cloud instance or in an orchestration system.\\nFigure 7-13. An ingestion process reads from a source database using JDBC, and then\\nwrites objects into object storage. A target database (not shown) can be triggered to\\ningest the data with an API call from an orchestration system.\\nChange Data Capture\\nChange data capture  (CDC), introduced in Chapter 2 , is the process of ingesting\\nchanges from a source database system.

We introduce you to com‐\\nmon patterns but suggest that you read the documentation on a particular database to\\nhandle the details of CDC strategies.\\nBatch-oriented CDC\\nIf the database table in question has an updated_at field containing the last time a\\nrecord was written or updated, we can query the table to find all updated rows since\\na specified time. We set the filter timestamp based on when we last captured changed\\nrows from the tables. This process allows us to pull changes and differentially update\\na target table.\\nThis form of batch-oriented CDC has a key limitation: while we can easily determine\\nwhich rows have changed since a point in time, we don’t necessarily obtain all\\nchanges that were applied to these rows.

This issue can be mitigated by utilizing\\nan insert-only schema, where each account transaction is recorded as a new record in\\nthe table (see “Insert-Only” on page 162).\\nContinuous CDC\\nContinuous CDC captures all table history and can support near real-time data inges‐\\ntion, either for real-time database replication or to feed real-time streaming analytics.\\nRather than running periodic queries to get a batch of table changes, continuous\\nCDC treats each write to the database as an event.\\nWe can capture an event stream for continuous CDC in a couple of ways. One\\nof the most common approaches with a transactional database such as PostgreSQL\\nis log-based CDC . The database binary log records every change to the database\\nsequentially (see “Database Logs” on page 161). A CDC tool can read this log and\\nsend the events to a target, such as the Apache Kafka Debezium streaming platform.\\nSome databases support a simplified, managed CDC paradigm. For instance, many\\ncloud-hosted databases can be configured to directly trigger a serverless function\\nor write to an event stream every time a change happens in the database. This com‐\\npletely frees engineers from worrying about the details of how events are captured in\\nthe database and forwarded.\\nCDC and database replication\\nCDC can be used to replicate between databases: events are buffered into a stream\\nand asynchronously written into a second database. However, many databases natively\\nsupport a tightly coupled version of replication (synchronous replication) that keeps\\nthe replica fully in sync with the primary database. Synchronous replication typi‐\\ncally requires that the primary database and the replica are of the same type (e.g.,\\nPostgreSQL to PostgreSQL). The advantage of synchronous replication is that the\\nsecondary database can offload work from the primary database by acting as a read\\nreplica; read queries can be redirected to the replica. The query will return the same\\nresults that would be returned from the primary database.\\nRead replicas are often used in batch data ingestion patterns to allow large scans\\nto run without overloading the primary production database.

As\\nreal-time data becomes more ubiquitous, you’ll often find yourself either introducing\\nor retrofitting ways to handle real-time data in your ingestion workflows. As such,\\nit’s essential to know how to ingest real-time data. Popular real-time data ingestion\\nincludes message queues or event-streaming platforms, which we covered in Chap‐\\nter 5. Though these are both source systems, they also act as ways to ingest data. In\\nboth cases, you consume events from the publisher you subscribe to.\\nRecall the differences between messages and streams. A message is handled at the\\nindividual event level and is meant to be transient. Once a message is consumed, it\\nis acknowledged and removed from the queue. On the other hand, a stream ingests\\nevents into an ordered log. The log persists for as long as you wish, allowing events\\nto be queried over various ranges, aggregated, and combined with other streams to\\ncreate new transformations published to downstream consumers.

Ingestion can be nonlinear, with data\\nbeing published, consumed, republished, and reconsumed. When designing your\\nreal-time ingestion workflows, keep in mind how data will flow.\\nAnother consideration is the throughput of your real-time data pipelines.

Data\\nengineers will find that some data sources do not support more modern means of\\ndata transport, often because of archaic IT systems or human process limitations.\\nEngineers can at least enhance EDI through automation. For example, they can set\\nup a cloud-based email server that saves files onto company object storage as soon\\nas they are received. This can trigger orchestration processes to ingest and process\\ndata. This is much more robust than an employee downloading the attached file and\\nmanually uploading it to an internal system, which we still frequently see.\\nDatabases and File Export\\nEngineers should be aware of how the source database systems handle file export.\\nExport involves large data scans that significantly load the database for many transac‐\\ntional systems. Source system engineers must assess when these scans can be run\\nwithout affecting application performance and might opt for a strategy to mitigate the\\nload. Export queries can be broken into smaller exports by querying over key ranges\\nor one partition at a time. Alternatively, a read replica can reduce load.

First, ask yourself if you should be web scraping or if data is available from\\na third party. If your decision is to web scrape, be a good citizen. Don’t inadvertently\\ncreate a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, and don’t get your IP address blocked. Under‐\\nstand how much traffic you generate and pace your web-crawling activities appropri‐\\nately. Just because you can spin up thousands of simultaneous Lambda functions to\\nscrape doesn’t mean you should; excessive web scraping could lead to the disabling of\\nyour AWS account.\\nSecond, be aware of the legal implications of your activities. Again, generating DoS\\nattacks can entail legal consequences. Actions that violate terms of service may cause\\nheadaches for your employer or you personally.\\nThird, web pages constantly change their HTML element structure, making it tricky\\nto keep your web scraper updated. Ask yourself, is the headache of maintaining these\\nsystems worth the effort?\\nWeb scraping has interesting implications for the data engineering lifecycle process‐\\ning stage; engineers should think about various factors at the beginning of a web-\\nscraping project. What do you intend to do with the data? Are you just pulling\\nrequired fields from the scraped HTML by using Python code and then writing these\\nvalues to a database? Do you intend to maintain the complete HTML code of the\\nscraped websites and process this data using a framework like Spark? These decisions\\nmay lead to very different architectures downstream of ingestion.\\nTransfer Appliances for Data Migration\\nFor massive quantities of data (100 TB or more), transferring data directly over the\\ninternet may be a slow and costly process. At this scale, the fastest, most efficient way\\nto move data is not over the wire but by truck. Cloud vendors offer the ability to send\\nyour data via a physical “box of hard drives. ” Simply order a storage device, called\\na transfer appliance, load your data from your servers, and then send it back to the\\ncloud vendor, which will upload your data.\\nThe suggestion is to consider using a transfer appliance if your data size hovers\\naround 100 TB. On the extreme end, AWS even offers Snowmobile, a transfer appli‐\\nance sent to you in a semitrailer! Snowmobile is intended to lift and shift an entire\\ndata center, in which data sizes are in the petabytes or greater.\\nTransfer appliances are handy for creating hybrid-cloud or multicloud setups. For\\nexample, Amazon’s data transfer appliance (AWS Snowball) supports import and\\nexport. To migrate into a second cloud, users can export their data into a Snowball\\ndevice and then import it into a second transfer appliance to move data into GCP\\nor Azure.

Data providers will offer datasets to third-party subscribers, either for free or\\nat a cost. These datasets are often shared in a read-only fashion, meaning you can\\nintegrate these datasets with your own data (and other third-party datasets), but you\\ndo not own the shared dataset. In the strict sense, this isn’t ingestion, where you get\\nphysical possession of the dataset.

Some of these platforms also provide data\\nmarketplaces where companies and organizations can offer their data for sale.\\nWhom You’ll Work With\\nData ingestion sits at several organizational boundaries. In developing and managing\\ndata ingestion pipelines, data engineers will work with both people and systems\\nsitting upstream (data producers) and downstream (data consumers).\\nUpstream Stakeholders\\nA significant disconnect often exists between those responsible for generating data\\n—typically, software engineers—and the data engineers who will prepare this data\\nfor analytics and data science. Software engineers and data engineers usually sit in\\nseparate organizational silos; if they think about data engineers, they typically see\\nthem simply as downstream consumers of the data exhaust from their application,\\nnot as stakeholders.\\nWe see this current state of affairs as a problem and a significant opportunity. Data\\nengineers can improve the quality of their data by inviting software engineers to be\\nstakeholders in data engineering outcomes.

Basic ingestion work\\nmay seem tedious, but delivering value to these core parts of the company will open\\nup more budget and more exciting long-term data engineering opportunities.\\nData engineers can also invite more executive participation in this collaborative\\nprocess.

This is the starting point for\\nlineage and data cataloging; from this point on, data engineers need to think about\\nschema changes, ethics, privacy, and compliance.\\nSchema changes\\nSchema changes (such as adding, changing, or removing columns in a database table)\\nremain, from our perspective, an unsettled issue in data management.

When Linus Torvalds was developing Git,\\nmany of his choices were inspired by the limitations of Concurrent Versions System\\n(CVS). CVS is completely centralized; it supports only one current official version of\\nthe code, stored on a central project server. To make Git a truly distributed system,\\nTorvalds used the notion of a tree; each developer could maintain their processed\\nbranch of the code and then merge to or from other branches.\\nA few years ago, such an approach to data was unthinkable.

As it turns out, this question often gets overlooked when\\ncreating requirements and solving problems.\\nData engineers should always train themselves to ask this question when setting\\nup ingestion pipelines. They will inevitably encounter sensitive data; the natural\\ntendency is to ingest it and forward it to the next step in the pipeline. But if this data\\nis not needed, why collect it at all? Why not simply drop sensitive fields before data is\\nstored? Data cannot leak if it is never collected.\\nWhere it is truly necessary to keep track of sensitive identities, it is common practice\\nto apply tokenization to anonymize identities in model training and analytics. But\\nengineers should look at where this tokenization is used. If possible, hash data at\\ningestion time.\\nData engineers cannot avoid working with highly sensitive data in some cases. Some\\nanalytics systems must present identifiable, sensitive information. Engineers must\\nact under the highest ethical standards whenever they handle sensitive data. In\\naddition, they can put in place a variety of practices to reduce the direct handling of\\nsensitive data. Aim as much as possible for touchless production where sensitive data\\nis involved. This means that engineers develop and test code on simulated or cleansed\\ndata in development and staging environments but automated code deployments to\\nproduction.\\nTouchless production is an ideal that engineers should strive for, but situations\\ninevitably arise that cannot be fully solved in development and staging environments.\\nSome bugs may not be reproducible without looking at the live data that is triggering\\na regression. For these cases, put a broken-glass process in place: require at least two\\npeople to approve access to sensitive data in the production environment. This access\\nshould be tightly scoped to a particular issue and come with an expiration date.\\nOur last bit of advice on sensitive data: be wary of naive technological solutions to\\nhuman problems. Both encryption and tokenization are often treated like privacy\\nmagic bullets. Most cloud-based storage systems and nearly all databases encrypt data\\nat rest and in motion by default. Generally, we don’t see encryption problems but data\\naccess problems. Is the solution to apply an extra layer of encryption to a single field\\nor to control access to that field?

Most of the concepts\\nfor OLAP databases and SQL will translate to other types of databases and query\\nlanguages.

If these ideas are unfamiliar to you,\\ncountless resources are available to help you get started.\\nA note on the terms used in this chapter. For convenience, we’ll use the term database\\nas a shorthand for a query engine and the storage it’s querying; this could be a\\ncloud data warehouse or Apache Spark querying data stored in S3. We assume the\\ndatabase has a storage engine that organizes the data under the hood. This extends to\\nfile-based queries (loading a CSV file into a Python notebook) and queries against file\\nformats such as Parquet.\\nAlso, note that this chapter focuses mainly on the query, modeling patterns, and\\ntransformations related to structured and semistructured data, which data engineers\\nuse often. Many of the practices discussed can also be applied to working with\\nunstructured data such as images, video, and raw text.\\nBefore we get into modeling and transforming data, let’s look at queries—what they\\nare, how they work, considerations for improving query performance, and queries on\\nstreaming data.\\nQueries\\nQueries are a fundamental part of data engineering, data science, and analysis.

As a data engineer, you’ll most frequently query and transform these data\\ntypes.

Some of this introductory material on queries will be\\nfamiliar to experienced data engineers; feel free to skip ahead if this applies to you.\\nA query allows you to retrieve and act on data. Recall our conversation in Chapter 5\\nabout CRUD. When a query retrieves data, it is issuing a request to read a pattern of\\nrecords. This is the R (read) in CRUD. Y ou might issue a query that gets all records\\nfrom a table foo, such as SELECT * FROM foo . Or, you might apply a predicate\\n(logical condition) to filter your data by retrieving only records where the id is 1,\\nusing the SQL query SELECT * FROM foo WHERE id=1.\\nMany databases allow you to create, update, and delete data. These are the CUD in\\nCRUD; your query will either create, mutate, or destroy existing records. Let’s review\\nsome other common acronyms you’ll run into when working with query languages.\\nData definition language\\nAt a high level, you first need to create the database objects before adding data. Y ou’ll\\nuse data definition language  (DDL) commands to perform operations on database\\nobjects, such as the database itself, schemas, tables, or users; DDL defines the state of\\nobjects in your database.\\nData engineers use common SQL DDL expressions: CREATE, DROP, and UPDATE. For\\nexample, you can create a database by using the DDL expression CREATE DATABASE\\nbar. After that, you can also create new tables ( CREATE table bar_table) or delete a\\ntable (DROP table bar_table).\\nData manipulation language\\nAfter using DDL to define database objects, you need to add and alter data within\\nthese objects, which is the primary purpose of data manipulation language (DML).\\nSome common DML commands you’ll use as a data engineer are as follows:\\nSELECT\\nINSERT\\nUPDATE\\nDELETE\\nCOPY\\nMERGE\\nFor example, you can INSERT new records into a database table, UPDATE existing ones,\\nand SELECT specific records.\\nQueries | 273'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 298, 'page_label': '273'}, page_content='Data control language\\nY ou most likely want to limit access to database objects and finely control who has\\naccess to what.

A new data scientist\\nnamed Sarah joins your company, and she needs read-only access to a database called\\ndata_science_db. Y ou give Sarah access to this database by using the following DCL\\ncommand:\\nGRANT SELECT ON data_science_db TO user_name Sarah;\\nIt’s a hot job market, and Sarah has worked at the company for only a few months\\nbefore getting poached by a big tech company. So long, Sarah! Being a security-\\nminded data engineer, you remove Sarah’s ability to read from the database:\\nREVOKE SELECT ON data_science_db TO user_name Sarah;\\nAccess-control requests and issues are common, and understanding DCL will help\\nyou resolve problems if you or a team member can’t access the data they need, as well\\nas prevent access to data they don’t need.\\nTransaction control language\\nAs its name suggests, transaction control language  (TCL) supports commands that\\ncontrol the details of transactions. With TCL, we can define commit checkpoints,\\nconditions when actions will be rolled back, and more.

A query optimizer’s job is to optimize query performance and minimize costs\\nby breaking the query into appropriate steps in an efficient order. The optimizer will\\nassess joins, indexes, data scan size, and other factors. The query optimizer attempts\\nto execute the query in the least expensive manner.\\nQuery optimizers are fundamental to how your query will perform.

Knowing\\nhow to identify and fix these queries is invaluable. Don’t fight your database. Learn to\\nwork with its strengths and augment its weaknesses. This section shows various ways\\nto improve your query performance.\\nOptimize your join strategy and schema\\nA single dataset (such as a table or file) is rarely useful on its own; we create value\\nby combining it with other datasets. Joins are one of the most common means of\\ncombining datasets and creating new ones. We assume that you’re familiar with\\nthe significant types of joins (e.g., inner, outer, left, cross) and the types of join\\nrelationships (e.g., one to one, one to many, many to one, and many to many).\\nQueries | 275'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 300, 'page_label': '275'}, page_content='Joins are critical in data engineering and are well supported and performant in many\\ndatabases. Even columnar databases, which in the past had a reputation for slow join\\nperformance, now generally offer excellent performance.\\nA common technique for improving query performance is to  prejoin data. If you find\\nthat analytics queries are joining the same data repeatedly, it often makes sense to\\njoin the data in advance and have queries read from the prejoined version of the\\ndata so that you’re not repeating computationally intensive work. This may mean\\nchanging the schema and relaxing normalization conditions to widen tables and\\nutilize newer data structures (such as arrays or structs) for replacing frequently joined\\nentity relationships. Another strategy is maintaining a more normalized schema but\\nprejoining tables for the most common analytics and data science use cases. We\\ncan simply create prejoined tables and train users to utilize these or join inside\\nmaterialized views (see “Materialized Views, Federation, and Query Virtualization”\\non page 323).\\nNext, consider the details and complexity of your join conditions. Complex join logic\\nmay consume significant computational resources. We can improve performance for\\ncomplex joins in a few ways.\\nMany row-oriented databases allow you to index a result computed from a row.\\nFor instance, PostgreSQL allows you to create an index on a string field converted\\nto lowercase; when the optimizer encounters a query where the lower() function\\nappears inside a predicate, it can apply the index. Y ou can also create a new derived\\ncolumn for joining, though you will need to train users to join on this column.\\nRow Explosion\\nAn obscure but frustrating problem is row explosion . This occurs when we have a\\nlarge number of many-to-many matches, either because of repetition in join keys or\\nas a consequence of join logic. Suppose the join key in table A has the value this\\nrepeated five times, and the join key in table B contains this same value repeated 10\\ntimes. This leads to a cross-join of these rows: every this row from table A paired\\nwith every this row from table B. This creates 5 × 10 = 50 rows in the output. Now\\nsuppose that many other repeats are in the join key. Row explosion often generates\\nenough rows to consume a massive quantity of database resources or even cause a\\nquery to fail.\\nIt is also essential to know how your query optimizer handles joins. Some databases\\ncan reorder joins and predicates, while others cannot. A row explosion in an early\\nquery stage may cause the query to fail, even though a later predicate should correctly\\nremove many of the repeats in the output.

If you’ d like to learn more about CTEs, a quick web search will yield\\nplenty of helpful information.\\nUse the explain plan and understand your query’s performance\\nAs you learned in the preceding section, the database’s query optimizer influences\\nthe execution of a query. The query optimizer’s explain plan will show you how the\\nquery optimizer determined its optimum lowest-cost query, the database objects used\\n(tables, indexes, cache, etc.), and various resource consumption and performance\\nstatistics in each query stage. Some databases provide a visual representation of query\\nstages. In contrast, others make the explain plan available via SQL with the EXPLAIN\\ncommand, which displays the sequence of steps the database will take to execute the\\nquery.\\nIn addition to using EXPLAIN to understand how your query will run, you should\\nmonitor your query’s performance, viewing metrics on database resource consump‐\\ntion. The following are some areas to monitor:\\n• Usage of key resources such as disk, memory, and network.•\\n• Data loading time versus processing time.•\\n• Query execution time, number of records, the size of the data scanned, and the•\\nquantity of data shuffled.\\n• Competing queries that might cause resource contention in your database.•\\n• Number of concurrent connections used versus connections available.

As a rule of thumb, you\\nshould query only the data you need. When you run SELECT * with no predicates,\\nyou’re scanning the entire table and retrieving every row and column.

Most\\ncolumn-oriented OLAP databases also provide additional tools for optimizing your\\ntables for better query performance. For instance, if you have a very large table\\n(several terabytes in size or greater), Snowflake and BigQuery give you the option\\nto define a cluster key on a table, which orders the table’s data in a way that allows\\nqueries to more efficiently access portions of very large datasets. BigQuery also allows\\nyou to partition a table into smaller segments, allowing you to query only specific\\npartitions instead of the entire table. (Be aware that inappropriate clustering and key\\ndistribution strategies can degrade performance.)\\nIn row-oriented databases, pruning usually centers around table indexes, which you\\nlearned in Chapter 6. The general strategy is to create table indexes that will improve\\nperformance for your most performance-sensitive queries while not overloading the\\ntable with so many indexes such that you degrade performance.\\nKnow how your database handles commits\\nA database commit is a change within a database, such as creating, updating, or delet‐\\ning a record, table, or other database objects. Many databases support transactions—\\ni.e., a notion of committing several operations simultaneously in a way that maintains\\na consistent state. Please note that the term transaction is somewhat overloaded; see\\nChapter 5 . The purpose of a transaction is to keep a consistent state of a database\\nboth while it’s active and in the event of a failure. Transactions also handle isolation\\nwhen multiple concurrent events might be reading, writing, and deleting from the\\nsame database objects. Without transactions, users would get potentially conflicting\\ninformation when querying a database.\\nY ou should be intimately familiar with how your database handles commits and\\ntransactions, and determine the expected consistency of query results. Does your\\ndatabase handle writes and updates in an ACID-compliant manner? Without ACID\\ncompliance, your query might return unexpected results. This could result from a\\ndirty read, which happens when a row is read and an uncommitted transaction has\\naltered the row. Are dirty reads an expected behavior of your database? If so, how\\ndo you handle this? Also, be aware that during update and delete transactions, some\\ndatabases create new files to represent the new state of the database and retain the old\\nfiles for failure checkpoint references. In these databases, running a large number of\\nsmall commits can lead to clutter and consume significant storage space that might\\nneed to be vacuumed periodically.\\nLet’s briefly consider three databases to understand the impact of commits (note these\\nexamples are current as of the time of this writing).

We can also run\\nanalytics queries across many rows; these queries will present a consistent picture of\\nthe database at a point in time.\\nThe disadvantage of the PostgreSQL approach is that it requires row locking (blocking\\nreads and writes to certain rows), which can degrade performance in various ways.\\nPostgreSQL is not optimized for large scans or the massive amounts of data appropri‐\\nate for large-scale analytics applications.\\nNext, consider Google BigQuery. It utilizes a point-in-time full table commit model.\\nWhen a read query is issued, BigQuery will read from the latest committed snapshot\\nof the table. Whether the query runs for one second or two hours, it will read only\\nfrom that snapshot and will not see any subsequent changes. BigQuery does not lock\\nthe table while I read from it. Instead, subsequent write operations will create new\\ncommits and new snapshots while the query continues to run on the snapshot where\\nit started.\\nTo prevent the inconsistent state, BigQuery allows only one write operation at a time.\\nIn this sense, BigQuery provides no write concurrency whatsoever. (In the sense that\\nit can write massive amounts of data in parallel inside a single write query, it is highly\\nconcurrent.) If more than one client attempts to write simultaneously, write queries\\nare queued in order of arrival. BigQuery’s commit model is similar to the commit\\nmodels used by Snowflake, Spark, and others.\\nLast, let’s consider MongoDB. We refer to MongoDB as a variable-consistency data‐\\nbase. Engineers have various configurable consistency options, both for the database\\nand at the level of individual queries. MongoDB is celebrated for its extraordinary\\nscalability and write concurrency but is somewhat notorious for issues that arise\\nwhen engineers abuse it.1\\nFor instance, in certain modes, MongoDB supports ultra-high write performance.\\nHowever, this comes at a cost: the database will unceremoniously and silently discard\\nwrites if it gets overwhelmed with traffic. This is perfectly suitable for applications\\nthat can stand to lose some data—for example, IoT applications where we simply\\nwant many measurements but don’t care about capturing all measurements. It is not a\\ngreat fit for applications that need to capture exact data and statistics.\\nNone of this is to say these are bad databases.

As these old records accumu‐\\nlate in the database filesystem, they eventually no longer need to be referenced. Y ou\\nshould remove these dead records in a process called vacuuming.\\nY ou can vacuum a single table, multiple tables, or all tables in a database. No mat‐\\nter how you choose to vacuum, deleting dead database records is important for\\na few reasons. First, it frees up space for new records, leading to less table bloat\\nand faster queries. Second, new and relevant records mean query plans are more\\naccurate; outdated records can lead the query optimizer to generate suboptimal and\\ninaccurate plans. Finally, vacuuming cleans up poor indexes, allowing for better index\\nperformance.\\nVacuum operations are handled differently depending on the type of database. For\\nexample, in databases backed by object storage (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks),\\nthe only downside of old data retention is that it uses storage space, potentially\\ncosting money depending on the storage pricing model for the database. In Snow‐\\nflake, users cannot directly vacuum. Instead, they control a “time-travel” interval that\\ndetermines how long table snapshots are retained before they are auto vacuumed.\\nBigQuery utilizes a fixed seven-day history window. Databricks generally retains data\\nindefinitely until it is manually vacuumed; vacuuming is important to control direct\\nS3 storage costs.\\nAmazon Redshift handles its cluster disks in many configurations, 2 and vacuuming\\ncan impact performance and available storage. VACUUM runs automatically behind the\\nscenes, but users may sometimes want to run it manually for tuning purposes.\\nVacuuming becomes even more critical for relational databases such as PostgreSQL\\nand MySQL. Large numbers of transactional operations can cause a rapid accumula‐\\ntion of dead records, and engineers working in these systems need to familiarize\\nthemselves with the details and impact of vacuuming.\\n280 | Chapter 8: Queries, Modeling, and Transformation'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 305, 'page_label': '280'}, page_content='3 The authors are aware of an incident involving a new analyst at a large grocery store chain running SELECT *\\non a production database and bringing down a critical inventory database for three days.\\nLeverage cached query results\\nLet’s say you have an intensive query that you often run on a database that charges\\nyou for the amount of data you query.

Assuming your database caches query results, rerunning the same\\nquery might return results in 1 second or less. The results were cached, and the query\\ndidn’t need to run cold. Whenever possible, leverage query cache results to reduce\\npressure on your database and provide a better user experience for frequently run\\nqueries. Note also that materialized views provide another form of query caching (see\\n“Materialized Views, Federation, and Query Virtualization” on page 323).\\nQueries on Streaming Data\\nStreaming data is constantly in flight. As you might imagine, querying streaming\\ndata is different from batch data. To fully take advantage of a data stream, we must\\nadapt query patterns that reflect its real-time nature. For example, systems such as\\nKafka and Pulsar make it easier to query streaming data sources. Let’s look at some\\ncommon ways to do this.\\nBasic query patterns on streams\\nRecall continuous CDC, discussed in Chapter 7. CDC, in this form, essentially sets up\\nan analytics database as a fast follower to a production database. One of the longest-\\nstanding streaming query patterns simply entails querying the analytics database,\\nretrieving statistical results and aggregations with a slight lag behind the production\\ndatabase.\\nThe fast-follower approach.    How is this a streaming query pattern? Couldn’t we\\naccomplish the same thing simply by running our queries on the production data‐\\nbase? In principle, yes; in practice, no. Production databases generally aren’t equipped\\nto handle production workloads and simultaneously run large analytics scans across\\nsignificant quantities of data. Running such queries can slow the production applica‐\\ntion or even cause it to crash. 3 The basic CDC query pattern allows us to serve\\nreal-time analytics with a minimal impact on the production system.\\nQueries | 281'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 306, 'page_label': '281'}, page_content='The fast-follower pattern can utilize a conventional transactional database as the\\nfollower, but there are significant advantages to using a proper OLAP-oriented system\\n(Figure 8-3).

This works extremely well for computing trailing statistics on vast historical\\ndata with near real-time updates.\\nFigure 8-3.

Next, recall the Kappa architecture we discussed in Chapter 3.\\nThe principal idea of this architecture is to handle all data like events and store these\\nevents as a stream rather than a table ( Figure 8-4 ). When production application\\ndatabases are the source, Kappa architecture stores events from CDC. Event streams\\ncan also flow directly from an application backend, from a swarm of IoT devices,\\nor any system that generates events and can push them over a network. Instead of\\nsimply treating a streaming storage system as a buffer, Kappa architecture retains\\nevents in storage during a more extended retention period, and data can be directly\\nqueried from this storage. The retention period can be pretty long (months or years).\\nNote that this is much longer than the retention period used in purely real-time\\noriented systems, usually a week at most.\\nFigure 8-4. The Kappa architecture is built around streaming storage and ingest systems\\nThe “big idea” in Kappa architecture is to treat streaming storage as a real-time trans‐\\nport layer and a database for retrieving and querying historical data.

The streaming\\nstorage system can also feed other applications or a stream processor such as Flink or\\nBeam.\\nWindows, triggers, emitted statistics, and late-arriving data\\nOne fundamental limitation of traditional batch queries is that this paradigm gener‐\\nally treats the query engine as an external observer.

Let’s look at some common types of windows:\\nsession, fixed-time, and sliding. We’ll also look at watermarks.\\nSession window.    A session window groups events that occur close together, and filters\\nout periods of inactivity when no events occur. We might say that a user session\\nis any time interval with no inactivity gap of five minutes or more. Our batch\\nsystem collects data by a user ID key, orders events, determines the gaps and session\\nboundaries, and calculates statistics for each session. Data engineers often sessionize\\ndata retrospectively by applying time conditions to user activity on web and desktop\\napps.\\nIn a streaming session, this process can happen dynamically. Note that session win‐\\ndows are per key; in the preceding example, each user gets their own set of windows.\\nThe system accumulates data per user. If a five-minute gap with no activity occurs,\\nthe system closes the window, sends its calculations, and flushes the data. If new\\nevents arrive for the use, the system starts a new session window.\\nSession windows may also make a provision for late-arriving data. Allowing data to\\narrive up to five minutes late to account for network conditions and system latency,\\nthe system will open the window if a late-arriving event indicates activity less than\\nfive minutes after the last event.

With dynamic sessionization, the user could get an alert in a\\nmobile app that is immediately useful based on their activity in the last 15 minutes.\\nFixed-time windows.    A fixed-time (aka tumbling) window features fixed time periods\\nthat run on a fixed schedule and processes all data since the previous window is\\nclosed. For example, we might close a window every 20 seconds and process all data\\narriving from the previous window to give a mean and median statistic ( Figure 8-6).\\nStatistics would be emitted as soon as they could be calculated after the window\\nclosed.\\nFigure 8-6.

However, this would entail starting\\nover when a request comes in for a report with finer-grained data aggregation.\\nSince the data engineer is actually quite experienced, they elect to create tables with\\ndetailed data on customer orders, including each order, item, item cost, item IDs,\\netc. Essentially, their tables contain all details on customer orders.

The normal forms are sequential, with\\neach form incorporating the conditions of prior forms. We describe Codd’s first three\\nnormal forms here:\\nDenormalized\\nNo normalization. Nested and redundant data is allowed.\\nFirst normal form (1NF)\\nEach column is unique and has a single value. The table has a unique primary\\nkey.\\nSecond normal form (2NF)\\nThe requirements of 1NF , plus partial dependencies are removed.\\nThird normal form (3NF)\\nThe requirements of 2NF , plus each table contains only relevant fields related to\\nits primary key and has no transitive dependencies.\\nIt’s worth spending a moment to unpack a couple of terms we just threw at you. A\\nunique primary key is a single field or set of multiple fields that uniquely determines\\nrows in the table. Each key value occurs at most once; otherwise, a value would map\\nto multiple rows in the table. Thus, every other value in a row is dependent on (can\\nbe determined from) the key. A partial dependency occurs when a subset of fields in\\na composite key can be used to determine a nonkey column of the table.

For a data engineer, these\\nbooks are must-reads, and we highly encourage you to read them,\\nif only to understand how and why data modeling is central to\\nbatch analytical data.\\nInmon\\nThe father of the data warehouse, Bill Inmon, created his approach to data modeling\\nin 1989. Before the data warehouse, the analysis would often occur directly on the\\nsource system itself, with the obvious consequence of bogging down production\\ntransactional databases with long-running queries. The goal of the data warehouse\\nwas to separate the source system from the analytical system.\\nInmon defines a data warehouse the following way:7\\nA data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant col‐\\nlection of data in support of management’s decisions. The data warehouse contains\\ngranular corporate data. Data in the data warehouse is able to be used for many\\ndifferent purposes, including sitting and waiting for future requirements which are\\nunknown today.\\nThe four critical parts of a data warehouse can be described as follows:\\nSubject-oriented\\nThe data warehouse focuses on a specific subject area, such as sales or marketing.\\nIntegrated\\nData from disparate sources is consolidated and normalized.\\nNonvolatile\\nData remains unchanged after data is stored in a data warehouse.\\nTime-variant\\nVarying time ranges can be queried.\\nLet’s look at each of these parts to understand its influence on an Inmon data\\nmodel. First, the logical model must focus on a specific area. For instance, if the\\nsubject orientation is “sales, ” then the logical model contains all details related to sales\\n—business keys, relationships, attributes, etc. Next, these details are  integrated into a\\nconsolidated and highly normalized data model. Finally, the data is stored unchanged\\nin a nonvolatile and time-variant way, meaning you can (theoretically) query the\\noriginal data for as long as storage history allows.

Of all\\nthe aspects of a data warehouse, integration is the most important. Data is fed from\\nmultiple, disparate sources into the data warehouse. As the data is fed, it is converted,\\nreformatted, resequenced, summarized, etc. The result is that data—once it resides in\\nthe data warehouse—has a single physical corporate image.\\nWith Inmon’s data warehouse, data is integrated from across the organization in a\\ngranular, highly normalized ER model, with a relentless emphasis on ETL. Because\\nof the subject-oriented nature of the data warehouse, the Inmon data warehouse\\nconsists of key source databases and information systems used in an organization.\\nData from key business source systems is ingested and integrated into a highly\\nnormalized (3NF) data warehouse that often closely resembles the normalization\\nstructure of the source system itself; data is brought in incrementally, starting with\\nthe highest-priority business areas. The strict normalization requirement ensures as\\nlittle data duplication as possible, which leads to fewer downstream analytical errors\\nbecause data won’t diverge or suffer from redundancies. The data warehouse repre‐\\nsents a “single source of truth, ” which supports the overall business’s information\\nrequirements. The data is presented for downstream reports and analysis via business\\nand department-specific data marts, which may also be denormalized.\\nLet’s look at how an Inmon data warehouse is used for ecommerce ( Figure 8-13 ).\\nThe business source systems are orders, inventory, and marketing. The data from\\nthese source systems are ETLed to the data warehouse and stored in 3NF . Ideally,\\nthe data warehouse holistically encompasses the business’s information. To serve data\\nfor department-specific information requests, ETL processes take data from the data\\nwarehouse, transform the data, and place it in downstream data marts to be viewed in\\nreports.\\nA popular option for modeling data in a data mart is a star schema (discussed\\nin the following section on Kimball), though any data model that provides easily\\naccessible information is also suitable. In the preceding example, sales, marketing,\\nand purchasing have their own star schema, fed upstream from the granular data in\\nthe data warehouse. This allows each department to have its own data structure that’s\\nunique and optimized to its specific needs.\\nInmon continues to innovate in the data warehouse space, currently focusing on\\ntextual ETL in the data warehouse.

An ecommerce data warehouse\\nKimball\\nIf there are spectrums to data modeling, Kimball is very much on the opposite end of\\nInmon. Created by Ralph Kimball in the early 1990s, this approach to data modeling\\nfocuses less on normalization, and in some cases accepting denormalization. As\\nInmon says about the difference between the data warehouse and data mart, “ A data\\nmart is never a substitute for a data warehouse. ”9\\nWhereas Inmon integrates data from across the business in the data warehouse, and\\nserves department-specific analytics via data marts, the Kimball model is bottom-up,\\nencouraging you to model and serve department or business analytics in the data\\nwarehouse itself (Inmon argues this approach skews the definition of a data ware‐\\nhouse). The Kimball approach effectively makes the data mart the data warehouse\\nitself. This may enable faster iteration and modeling than Inmon, with the trade-off\\nof potential looser data integration, data redundancy, and duplication.\\nIn Kimball’s approach, data is modeled with two general types of tables: facts and\\ndimensions. Y ou can think of a fact table as a table of numbers, and dimension tables\\nas qualitative data referencing a fact. Dimension tables surround a single fact table in\\na relationship called a star schema (Figure 8-14).10 Let’s look at facts, dimensions, and\\nstar schemas.\\nData Modeling | 297'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 322, 'page_label': '297'}, page_content='Figure 8-14. A Kimball star schema, with facts and dimensions\\nFact tables.    The first type of table in a star schema is the fact table, which contains\\nfactual, quantitative, and event-related data. The data in a fact table is immutable\\nbecause facts relate to events. Therefore, fact tables don’t change and are append-only.\\nFact tables are typically narrow and long, meaning they have not a lot of columns but\\na lot of rows that represent events. Fact tables should be at the lowest grain possible.\\nQueries against a star schema start with the fact table. Each row of a fact table should\\nrepresent the grain of the data. Avoid aggregating or deriving data within a fact table.\\nIf you need to perform aggregations or derivations, do so in a downstream query,\\ndata mart table, or view. Finally, fact tables don’t reference other fact tables; they\\nreference only dimensions.\\nLet’s look at an example of an elementary fact table ( Table 8-9). A common question\\nin your company might be, “Show me gross sales, by each customer order, by date. ”\\nAgain, facts should be at the lowest grain possible—in this case, the orderID of\\nthe sale, customer, date, and gross sale amount. Notice that the data types in the\\nfact table are all numbers (integers and floats); there are no strings. Also, in this\\nexample, CustomerKey 7 has two orders on the same day, reflecting the grain of\\nthe table. Instead, the fact table has keys that reference dimension tables containing\\ntheir respective attributes, such as the customer and date information. The gross sales\\namount represents the total sale for the sales event.\\nTable 8-9.

With\\nthe date dimension table, you can easily answer questions like, “What are my total\\nsales in the first quarter of 2022?” or “How many more customers shop on Tuesday\\nthan Wednesday?” Notice we have five fields in addition to the date key ( Table 8-10).\\nThe beauty of a date dimension is that you can add as many new fields as makes sense\\nto analyze your data.\\nTable 8-10.

Another\\nadvantage of a star schema is it’s arguably easier for business users to understand and\\nuse.\\nNote that the star schema shouldn’t reflect a particular report, though you can model\\na report in a downstream data mart or directly in your BI tool. The star schema\\nshould capture the facts and attributes of your business logic and be flexible enough to\\nanswer the respective critical questions.\\nBecause a star schema has one fact table, sometimes you’ll have multiple star sche‐\\nmas that address different facts of the business. Y ou should strive to reduce the\\nnumber of dimensions whenever possible since this reference data can potentially be\\nreused among different fact tables. A dimension that is reused across multiple star\\nschemas, thus sharing the same fields, is called a conformed dimension. A conformed\\ndimension allows you to combine multiple fact tables across multiple star schemas.\\nRemember, redundant data is OK with the Kimball method, but avoid replicating the\\nsame dimension tables to avoid drifting business definitions and data integrity.\\nThe Kimball data model and star schema have a lot of nuance. Y ou should be aware\\nthat this mode is appropriate only for batch data and not for streaming data. Because\\nthe Kimball data model is popular, there’s a good chance you’ll run into it.\\nData Vault\\nWhereas Kimball and Inmon focus on the structure of business logic in the data\\nwarehouse, the Data Vault offers a different approach to data modeling. 11 Created\\nin the 1990s by Dan Linstedt, the Data Vault methodology separates the structural\\naspects of a source system’s data from its attributes. Instead of representing business\\nlogic in facts, dimensions, or highly normalized tables, a Data Vault simply loads data\\nfrom source systems directly into a handful of purpose-built tables in an insert-only\\nmanner. Unlike the other data modeling approaches you’ve learned about, there’s no\\nnotion of good, bad, or conformed data in a Data Vault.\\nData moves fast these days, and data models need to be agile, flexible, and scalable;\\nthe Data Vault methodology aims to meet this need. The goal of this methodology\\nis to keep the data as closely aligned to the business as possible, even while the\\nbusiness’s data evolves.\\nData Modeling | 301'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 326, 'page_label': '301'}, page_content='12 Kent Graziano, “Data Vault 2.0 Modeling Basics, ” Vertabelo, October 20, 2015, https://oreil.ly/iuW1U.\\nA Data Vault model consists of three main types of tables: hubs, links, and satellites\\n(Figure 8-15 ).

We don’t cover these here, but mention them because the Data Vault is quite\\ncomprehensive. Our goal is to simply give you an overview of the Data Vault’s power.\\nUnlike other data modeling techniques we’ve discussed, in a Data Vault, the business\\nlogic is created and interpreted when the data from these tables is queried.

The Data\\nVault is a huge topic, and this section is simply meant to make you aware of its\\nexistence.\\nWide denormalized tables\\nThe strict modeling approaches we’ve described, especially Kimball and Inmon,\\nwere developed when data warehouses were expensive, on premises, and heavily\\nresource-constrained with tightly coupled compute and storage. While batch data\\nmodeling has traditionally been associated with these strict approaches, more relaxed\\napproaches are becoming more common.\\nThere are reasons for this. First, the popularity of the cloud means that storage is\\ndirt cheap. It’s cheaper to store data than agonize over the optimum way to represent\\nthe data in storage. Second, the popularity of nested data (JSON and similar) means\\nschemas are flexible in source and analytical systems.\\nY ou have the option to rigidly model your data as we’ve described, or you can choose\\nto throw all of your data into a single wide table. A wide table is just what it sounds\\nlike: a highly denormalized and very wide collection of many fields, typically created\\nin a columnar database. A field may be a single value or contain nested data. The data\\nis organized along with one or multiple keys; these keys are closely tied to the grain of\\nthe data.\\nData Modeling | 305'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 330, 'page_label': '305'}, page_content='A wide table can potentially have thousands of columns, whereas fewer than 100\\nare typical in relational databases. Wide tables are usually sparse; the vast majority\\nof entries in a given field may be null.

A wide schema\\nin a relational database dramatically slows reading because each row must allocate all\\nthe space specified by the wide schema, and the database must read the contents of\\neach row in its entirety. On the other hand, a columnar database reads only columns\\nselected in a query, and reading nulls is essentially free.\\nWide tables generally arise through schema evolution; engineers gradually add fields\\nover time. Schema evolution in a relational database is a slow and resource-heavy\\nprocess. In a columnar database, adding a field is initially just a change to metadata.\\nAs data is written into the new field, new files are added to the column.\\nAnalytics queries on wide tables often run faster than equivalent queries on highly\\nnormalized data requiring many joins. Removing joins can have a huge impact on\\nscan performance. The wide table simply contains all of the data you would have\\njoined in a more rigorous modeling approach. Facts and dimensions are represented\\nin the same table. The lack of data model rigor also means not a lot of thought\\nis involved. Load your data into a wide table and start querying it.

What are some of these criticisms?\\nThe biggest criticism is as you blend your data, you lose the business logic in your\\nanalytics. Another downside is the performance of updates to things like an element\\nin an array, which can be very painful.\\nLet’s look at an example of a wide table ( Table 8-21), using the original denormal‐\\nized table from our earlier normalization example.

Prefiltering data to create broadcast joins where possible can dramatically\\nimprove performance and reduce resource consumption.\\nShuffle hash join.    If neither table is small enough to fit on a single node, the query\\nengine will use a shuffle hash join . In Figure 8-18 , the same nodes are represented\\nabove and below the dotted line. The area above the dotted line represents the initial\\npartitioning of tables A and B across the nodes. In general, this partitioning will have\\nno relation to the join key. A hashing scheme is used to repartition data by join key.\\nFigure 8-18. Shuffle hash join\\nIn this example, the hashing scheme will partition the join key into three parts, with\\neach part assigned to a node. The data is then reshuffled to the appropriate node, and\\nthe new partitions for tables A and B on each node are joined. Shuffle hash joins are\\ngenerally more resource intensive than broadcast joins.\\nETL, ELT, and data pipelines\\nAs we discussed in Chapter 3, a widespread transformation pattern dating to the early\\ndays of relational databases is a batch ETL. Traditional ETL relies on an external\\ntransformation system to pull, transform, and clean data while preparing it for a\\ntarget schema, such as a data mart or a Kimball star schema. The transformed data\\nwould then be loaded into a target system, such as a data warehouse, where business\\nanalytics could be performed.\\nTransformations | 311'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 336, 'page_label': '311'}, page_content='14 Alex Woodie, “Lakehouses Prevent Data Swamps, Bill Inmon Says, ” Datanami, June 1, 2021,\\nhttps://oreil.ly/XMwWc.\\nThe ETL pattern itself was driven by the limitations of both source and target\\nsystems. The extract phase tended to be a major bottleneck, with the constraints\\nof the source RDBMS limiting the rate at which data could be pulled. And, the\\ntransformation was handled in a dedicated system because the target system was\\nextremely resource-constrained in both storage and CPU capacity.\\nA now-popular evolution of ETL is ELT. As data warehouse systems have grown in\\nperformance and storage capacity, it has become common to simply extract raw data\\nfrom a source system, import it into a data warehouse with minimal transformation,\\nand then clean and transform it directly in the warehouse system. (See our discussion\\nof data warehouses in Chapter 3  for a more detailed discussion of the difference\\nbetween ETL and ELT.)\\nA second, slightly different notion of ELT was popularized with the emergence\\nof data lakes. In this version, the data is not transformed at the time it’s loaded.\\nIndeed, massive quantities of data may be loaded with no preparation and no plan\\nwhatsoever. The assumption is that the transformation step will happen at some\\nundetermined future time. Ingesting data without a plan is a great recipe for a data\\nswamp. As Inmon says:14\\nI’ve always been a fan of ETL because of the fact that ETL forces you to transform data\\nbefore you put it into a form where you can work with it. But some organizations want\\nto simply take the data, put it into a database, then do the transformation.... I’ve seen\\ntoo many cases where the organization says, oh we’ll just put the data in and transform\\nit later. And guess what? Six months later, that data [has] never been touched.\\nWe have also seen that the line between ETL and ELT can become somewhat blurry\\nin a data lakehouse environment. With object storage as a base layer, it’s no longer\\nclear what’s in the database and out of the database. The ambiguity is further exa‐\\ncerbated with the emergence of data federation, virtualization, and live tables. (We\\ndiscuss these topics later in this section.)\\nIncreasingly, we feel that the terms ETL and ELT should be applied only at the micro\\nlevel (within individual transformation pipelines) rather than at the macro level (to\\ndescribe a transformation pattern for a whole organization). Organizations no longer\\nneed to standardize on ETL or ELT but can instead focus on applying the proper\\ntechnique on a case-by-case basis as they build data pipelines.\\nSQL and code-based transformation tools\\nAt this juncture, the distinction between SQL-based and non-SQL-based transforma‐\\ntion systems feels somewhat synthetic.

For example,\\nSpark SQL was an early feature of Apache Spark. Streaming-first frameworks such as\\nKafka, Flink, and Beam also support SQL, with varying features and functionality.\\nIt is more appropriate to think about SQL-only tools versus those that support more\\npowerful, general-purpose programming paradigms. SQL-only transformation tools\\nspan a wide variety of proprietary and open source options.\\nSQL is declarative...but it can still build complex data workflows.    We often hear SQL dis‐\\nmissed because it is “not procedural. ” This is technically correct. SQL is a declarative\\nlanguage: instead of coding a data processing procedure, SQL writers stipulate the\\ncharacteristics of their final data in set-theoretic language; the SQL compiler and\\noptimizer determine the steps required to put data in this state.\\nPeople sometimes imply that because SQL is not procedural, it cannot build out\\ncomplex pipelines. This is false. SQL can effectively be used to build complex DAGs\\nusing common table expressions, SQL scripts, or an orchestration tool.\\nTo be clear, SQL has limits, but we often see engineers doing things in Python and\\nSpark that could be more easily and efficiently done in SQL. For a better idea of the\\ntrade-offs we’re talking about, let’s look at a couple of examples of Spark and SQL.\\nExample: When to avoid SQL for batch transformations in Spark.    When you’re determining\\nwhether to use native Spark or PySpark code instead of Spark SQL or another SQL\\nengine, ask yourself the following questions:\\n1. How difficult is it to code the transformation in SQL?1.\\n2. How readable and maintainable will the resulting SQL code be?2.\\n3. Should some of the transformation code be pushed into a custom library for3.\\nfuture reuse across the organization?\\nRegarding question 1, many transformations coded in Spark could be realized in\\nfairly simple SQL statements. On the other hand, if the transformation is not realiz‐\\nable in SQL, or if it would be extremely awkward to implement, native Spark is a\\nbetter option. For example, we might be able to implement word stemming in SQL\\nby placing word suffixes in a table, joining with that table, using a parsing function\\nto find suffixes in words, and then reducing the word to its stem by using a substring\\nfunction. However, this sounds like an extremely complex process with numerous\\nedge cases to consider. A more powerful procedural programming language is a\\nbetter fit here.\\nQuestion 2 is closely related. The word-stemming query will be neither readable nor\\nmaintainable.\\nTransformations | 313'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 338, 'page_label': '313'}, page_content='15 We remind you to use UDFs responsibly. SQL UDFs often perform reasonably well. We’ve seen JavaScript\\nUDFs increase query time from a few minutes to several hours.\\nRegarding question 3, one of the major limitations of SQL is that it doesn’t include a\\nnatural notion of libraries or reusable code. One exception is that some SQL engines\\nallow you to maintain user-defined functions (UDFs) as objects inside a database. 15\\nHowever, these aren’t committed to a Git repository without an external CI/CD\\nsystem to manage deployment. Furthermore, SQL doesn’t have a good notion of\\nreusability for more complex query components. Of course, reusable libraries are\\neasy to create in Spark and PySpark.\\nWe will add that it is possible to recycle SQL in two ways. First, we can easily reuse\\nthe results of a SQL query by committing to a table or creating a view. This process\\nis often best handled in an orchestration tool such as Airflow so that downstream\\nqueries can start once the source query has finished. Second, Data Build Tool (dbt)\\nfacilitates the reuse of SQL statements and offers a templating language that makes\\ncustomization easier.\\nExample: Optimizing Spark and other processing frameworks.    Spark acolytes often com‐\\nplain that SQL doesn’t give them control over data processing. The SQL engine takes\\nyour statements, optimizes them, and compiles them into its processing steps. (In\\npractice, optimization may happen before or after compilation, or both.)\\nThis is a fair complaint, but a corollary exists. With Spark and other code-heavy\\nprocessing frameworks, the code writer becomes responsible for much of the opti‐\\nmization that is handled automatically in a SQL-based engine. The Spark API is\\npowerful and complex, meaning it is not so easy to identify candidates for reordering,\\ncombination, or decomposition. When embracing Spark, data engineering teams\\nneed to actively engage with the problems of Spark optimization, especially for\\nexpensive, long-running jobs. This means building optimization expertise on the\\nteam and teaching individual engineers how to optimize.\\nA few top-level things to keep in mind when coding in native Spark:\\n1.

We’re discussing DML in SQL,\\nwhich we introduced earlier in the chapter.\\nWe’ve mentioned several times throughout the book that the original data lake con‐\\ncept didn’t really account for updating data. This now seems nonsensical for several\\nreasons. Updating data has long been a key part of handling data transformation\\nresults, even though the big data community dismissed it. It is silly to rerun signif‐\\nicant amounts of work because we have no update capabilities. Thus, the data lake‐\\nhouse concept now builds in updates.

Insert only inserts new records without changing or deleting old records.\\nInsert-only patterns can be used to maintain a current view of data—for example, if\\nnew versions of records are inserted without deleting old records.

This antipattern\\nputs a massive load on the system. It also causes data to be written\\nin many separate files; this is extremely inefficient for subsequent\\nreads, and the data must be reclustered later.

The typical process of wrangling this data involves first trying to ingest\\nit. Often, the data is so malformed that a good deal of text preprocessing is involved.\\nDevelopers may choose to ingest the data as a single text field table—an entire row\\ningested as a single field.

These tools\\noften put off data engineers because they claim to be no code, which sounds unso‐\\nphisticated. We prefer to think of data wrangling tools as integrated development\\nenvironments (IDEs) for malformed data. In practice, data engineers spend way too\\nmuch time parsing nasty data; automation tools allow data engineers to spend time\\non more interesting tasks. Wrangling tools may also allow engineers to hand some\\nparsing and ingestion work off to analysts.\\nGraphical data-wrangling tools typically present a sample of data in a visual interface,\\nwith inferred types, statistics including distributions, anomalous data, outliers, and\\nnulls. Users can then add processing steps to fix data issues.

A key is used to redistribute data across the\\ncluster; once again, a spill to disk occurs as the data is written to each node. The SQL\\ntransformation filters through the rows in memory and discards the unused rows.\\nFinally, Spark converts the data into Parquet format, compresses it, and writes it back\\nto S3.

This isn’t because MapReduce is widely used by data engineers these days.\\nMapReduce was the defining batch data transformation pattern of the big data era,\\nit still influences many distributed systems data engineers use today, and it’s useful\\nfor data engineers to understand at a basic level. MapReduce was introduced by\\nGoogle in a follow-up to its paper on GFS. It was initially the de facto processing\\npattern of Hadoop, the open source analogue technology of GFS that we introduced\\nin Chapter 6.\\nA simple MapReduce job consists of a collection of map tasks that read individual\\ndata blocks scattered across the nodes, followed by a shuffle that redistributes result\\ndata across the cluster and a reduce step that aggregates data on each node. For\\nexample, suppose that we wanted to run the following SQL query:\\nSELECT COUNT(*), user_id\\nFROM user_events\\nGROUP BY user_id;\\nThe table data is spread across nodes in data blocks; the MapReduce job generates\\none map task per block. Each map task essentially runs the query on a single block\\n—i.e., it generates a count for each user ID that appears in the block. While a\\nblock might contain hundreds of megabytes, the full table could be petabytes in size.\\nHowever, the map portion of the job is a nearly perfect example of embarrassing\\nparallelism; the data scan rate across the full cluster essentially scales linearly with the\\nnumber of nodes.\\nWe then need to aggregate (reduce) to gather results from the full cluster. We’re\\nnot gathering results to a single node; rather, we redistribute results by key so that\\neach key ends up on one and only one node. This is the shuffle step, which is often\\nexecuted using a hashing algorithm on keys. Once the map results have been shuffled,\\nwe sum the results for each key. The key/count pairs can be written to the local disk\\non the node where they are computed. We collect the results stored across nodes to\\nview the full query results.\\nReal-world MapReduce jobs can be far more complex than what we describe here. A\\ncomplex query that filters with a WHERE clause joins three tables and applies a window\\nfunction that would consist of many map and reduce stages.\\nAfter MapReduce\\nGoogle’s original MapReduce model is extremely powerful but is now viewed as\\nexcessively rigid. It utilizes numerous short-lived ephemeral tasks that read from and\\nwrite to disk. In particular, no intermediate state is preserved in memory; all data is\\ntransferred between tasks by storing it to disk or pushing it over the network.

This worked to an extent; Map‐\\nReduce repeatedly set data processing records during the early days of Hadoop.\\nHowever, we have lived in a post-MapReduce world for quite some time. Post-\\nMapReduce processing does not truly discard MapReduce; it still includes the ele‐\\nments of map, shuffle, and reduce, but it relaxes the constraints of MapReduce to\\nallow for in-memory caching. 18 Recall that RAM is much faster than SSD and HDDs\\nin transfer speed and seek time. Persisting even a tiny amount of judiciously chosen\\ndata in memory can dramatically speed up specific data processing tasks and utterly\\ncrush the performance of MapReduce.\\nFor example, Spark, BigQuery, and various other data processing frameworks were\\ndesigned around in-memory processing. These frameworks treat data as a distributed\\nset that resides in memory. If data overflows available memory, this causes a spill to\\ndisk. The disk is treated as a second-class data-storage layer for processing, though it\\nis still highly valuable.\\nThe cloud is one of the drivers for the broader adoption of memory caching; it\\nis much more effective to lease memory during a specific processing job than to\\nown it 24 hours a day. Advancements in leveraging memory for transformations will\\ncontinue to yield gains for the foreseeable future.\\nMaterialized Views, Federation, and Query Virtualization\\nIn this section, we look at several techniques that virtualize query results by present‐\\ning them as table-like objects. These techniques can become part of a transformation\\npipeline or sit right before end-user data consumption.\\nViews\\nFirst, let’s review views to set the stage for materialized views. A view is a database\\nobject that we can select from just like any other table. In practice, a view is just a\\nquery that references other tables. When we select from a view, that database creates\\na new query that combines the view subquery with our query. The query optimizer\\nthen optimizes and runs the full query.\\nTransformations | 323'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 348, 'page_label': '323'}, page_content='Views play a variety of roles in a database. First, views can serve a security role.\\nFor example, views can select only specific columns and filter rows, thus providing\\nrestricted data access. Various views can be created for job roles depending on user\\ndata access.\\nSecond, a view might be used to provide a current deduplicated picture of data.\\nIf we’re using an insert-only pattern, a view may be used to return a deduplicated\\nversion of a table showing only the latest version of each record.\\nThird, views can be used to present common data access patterns. Suppose that\\nmarketing analysts must frequently run a query that joins five tables. We could create\\na view that joins together these five tables into a wide table. Analysts can then write\\nqueries that filter and aggregate on top of this view.\\nMaterialized views\\nWe mentioned materialized views in our earlier discussion of query caching. A\\npotential disadvantage of (nonmaterialized) views is that they don’t do any precom‐\\nputation. In the example of a view that joins five tables, this join must run every\\ntime a marketing analyst runs a query on this view, and the join could be extremely\\nexpensive.\\nA materialized view does some or all of the view computation in advance. In our\\nexample, a materialized view might save the five table join results every time a change\\noccurs in the source tables. Then, when a user references the view, they’re querying\\nfrom the prejoined data. A materialized view is a de facto transformation step, but the\\ndatabase manages execution for convenience.\\nMaterialized views may also serve a significant query optimization role depending\\non the database, even for queries that don’t directly reference them. Many query\\noptimizers can identify queries that “look like” a materialized view. An analyst may\\nrun a query that uses a filter that appears in a materialized view. The optimizer will\\nrewrite the query to select from the precomputed results.\\nComposable materialized views\\nIn general, materialized views do not allow for composition—that is, a materialized\\nview cannot select from another materialized view. However, we’ve recently seen\\nthe emergence of tools that support this capability. For example, Databricks has intro‐\\nduced the notion of live tables.

Analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers should\\nbe able to query a data source with the confidence the data is of the highest quality\\nand completeness and can be integrated into their workflows and data products. The\\nbusiness should be able to trust that transformed data is accurate and actionable.\\nUndercurrents\\nThe transformation stage is where your data mutates and morphs into something\\nuseful for the business. Because there are many moving parts, the undercurrents are\\nespecially critical at this stage.\\nSecurity\\nQueries and transformations combine disparate datasets into new datasets.

Finally,\\nnever allow unsecured or unencrypted data to traverse the public internet.\\nData Management\\nThough data management is essential at the source system stage (and every other\\nstage of the data engineering lifecycle), it’s especially critical at the transformation\\nstage. Transformation inherently creates new datasets that need to be managed. As\\nwith other stages of the data engineering lifecycle, it’s critical to involve all stake‐\\nholders in data models and transformations and manage their expectations. Also,\\nmake sure everyone agrees on naming conventions that align with the respective\\nbusiness definitions of the data. Proper naming conventions should be reflected in\\neasy-to-understand field names. Users can also check in a data catalog for more\\nclarity on what the field means when it was created, who maintains the dataset, and\\nother relevant information.\\nAccounting for definitional accuracy is key at the transformation stage. Does the\\ntransformation adhere to the expected business logic? Increasingly, the notion of\\na semantic or metrics layer that sits independent of transformations is becoming\\npopular. Instead of enforcing business logic within the transformation at runtime,\\nwhy not keep these definitions as a standalone stage before your transformation\\nlayer? While it’s still early days, expect to see semantic and metrics layers becoming\\nmore popular and commonplace in data engineering and data management.\\nBecause transformations involve mutating data, it’s critical to ensure that the data\\nyou’re using is free of defects and represents ground truth. If MDM is an option at\\nyour company, pursue its implementation. Conformed dimensions and other trans‐\\nformations rely on MDM to preserve data’s original integrity and ground truth. If\\nMDM isn’t possible, work with upstream stakeholders who control the data to ensure\\nthat any data you’re transforming is correct and complies with the agreed-upon\\nbusiness logic.\\nData transformations make it potentially difficult to know how a dataset was derived\\nalong the same lines. In Chapter 6, we discussed data catalogs. As we transform data,\\ndata lineage tools become invaluable.

Y ou need to monitor and be alerted for changes or anomalies in these\\nareas. The field of data observability is exploding right now, with a big focus on\\ndata reliability. There’s even a recent job title called data reliability engineer . This\\nsection emphasizes data observability and data health, which focuses on the query\\nand transformation stage.\\nLet’s start with the data side of DataOps. When you query data, are the inputs and\\noutputs correct? How do you know? If this query is saved to a table, is the schema\\ncorrect? How about the shape of the data and related statistics such as min/max\\nvalues, null counts, and more? Y ou should run data-quality tests on the input datasets\\nand the transformed dataset, which will ensure that the data meets the expectations of\\nupstream and downstream users. If there’s a data-quality issue in the transformation,\\nyou should have the ability to flag this issue, roll back the changes, and investigate the\\nroot cause.\\nNow let’s look at the Ops part of DataOps. How are the systems performing? Monitor\\nmetrics such as query queue length, query concurrency, memory usage, storage\\nutilization, network latency, and disk I/O. Use metric data to spot bottlenecks and\\npoor-performing queries that might be candidates for refactoring and tuning. If the\\nquery is perfectly fine, you’ll have a good idea of where to tune the database itself\\n(for instance, by clustering a table for faster lookup performance). Or, you may need\\nto upgrade the database’s compute resources. Today’s cloud and SaaS databases give\\nyou a ton of flexibility for quickly upgrading (and downgrading) your system. Take\\na data-driven approach and use your observability metrics to pinpoint whether you\\nhave a query or a systems-related issue.\\nThe shift toward SaaS-based analytical databases changes the cost profile of data\\nconsumption. In the days of on-premises data warehouses, the system and licenses\\nwere purchased up front, with no additional usage cost. Whereas traditional data\\nengineers would focus on performance optimization to squeeze the maximum utility\\nout of their expensive purchases, data engineers working with cloud data warehouses\\nthat charge on a consumption basis need to focus on cost management and cost\\noptimization.

On the other hand, if your queries and transformations don’t work well with\\nyour upstream systems, you’re in for a world of pain.\\nFor example, we often see data teams using the wrong data pipelines and databases\\nfor the job.

Data engineers work with data scientists and ML engi‐\\nneers to acquire, transform, and deliver the data necessary for model training.\\nThird, you’ll serve data through reverse ETL. Reverse ETL is the process of sending\\ndata back to data sources.

Reverse ETL is highly entangled\\nwith BI and ML.\\nBefore we get into these three major ways of serving data, let’s look at some general\\nconsiderations.\\nGeneral Considerations for Serving Data\\nBefore we get further into serving data, we have a few big considerations. First and\\nforemost is trust. People need to trust the data you’re providing. Additionally, you\\nneed to understand your use cases and users, the data products that will be produced,\\nhow you’ll be serving data (self-service or not), data definitions and logic, and data\\nmesh. The considerations we’ll discuss here are general and apply to any of the three\\nways of serving data. Understanding these considerations will help you be much\\nmore effective in serving your data customers.\\nTrust\\nIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about\\nthat, you’ll do things differently.\\n—Warren Buffett1\\nAbove all else, trust is the root consideration in serving data; end users need to trust\\nthe data they’re receiving. The fanciest, most sophisticated data architecture and serv‐\\ning layer are irrelevant if end users don’t believe the data is a reliable representation of\\ntheir business. A loss of trust is often a silent death knell for a data project, even if the\\nproject isn’t officially canceled until months or years later. The job of a data engineer\\nis to serve the best data possible, so you’ll want to make sure your data products\\nalways contain high-quality and trustworthy data.\\nAs you learn to serve data throughout this chapter, we’ll reinforce the idea of baking\\ntrust into your data and discuss pragmatic ways to accomplish this. We see too many\\ncases in which data teams are fixated on pushing out data without asking whether\\nstakeholders trust it in the first place. Often, stakeholders lose trust in the data.

Once\\nusers come to depend on data to accomplish business processes, they will require\\nthat data is consistently available and up-to-date per the commitments made by data\\nengineers. High-quality data is of little value if it’s not available as expected when it’s\\ntime to make a critical business decision.

In most companies, a data engineer is a\\ncouple of steps removed from the end users of a data product; a good data engineer\\nwill seek to fully understand outcomes for direct users such as data analysts and data\\nscientists or customers external to the company.\\n340 | Chapter 9: Serving Data for Analytics, Machine Learning, and Reverse ETL'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 365, 'page_label': '340'}, page_content='3 Clayton M.

A classic engineering mistake\\nis simply building without understanding the requirements, needs of the end user,\\nor product/market fit.

More usage of a data product\\ngenerates more useful data, which is used to improve the data product. Rinse and\\nrepeat.\\nWhen building a data product, keep these considerations in mind:\\n• When someone uses the data product, what do they hope to accomplish? All•\\ntoo often, data products are made without a clear understanding of the outcome\\nexpected by the user.\\n• Will the data product serve internal or external users?

The answer is nuanced, but it generally involves\\nunderstanding the end user. If the user is an executive who needs to understand\\nhow the business is doing, that person probably just wants a predefined dashboard\\nof clear and actionable metrics. The executive will likely ignore any self-serve tools\\nfor creating custom data views. If reports provoke further questions, they might have\\nanalysts at their disposal to pursue a deeper investigation. On the other hand, a user\\nwho is an analyst might already be pursuing self-service analytics via more powerful\\ntools such as SQL. Self-service analytics through a BI layer is not useful. The same\\nconsiderations apply to data science. Although granting self-service ML to “citizen\\ndata scientists” has been a goal of many automated ML vendors, adoption is still\\nnascent for the same reasons as self-service analytics. In these two extreme cases, a\\nself-service data product is a wrong tool for the job.\\nSuccessful self-service data projects boil down to having the right audience. Identify\\nthe self-service users and the “job” they want to do. What are they trying to accom‐\\nplish by using a self-service data product versus partnering with a data analyst to\\nget the job done? A group of executives with a background in data forms an ideal\\naudience for self-service; they likely want to slice and dice data themselves without\\nneeding to dust off their languishing SQL skills. Business leaders willing to invest the\\ntime to learn data skills through a company initiative and training program could also\\nrealize significant value from self-service.\\nDetermine how you will provide data to this group. What are their time requirements\\nfor new data? What happens if they inevitably want more data or change the scope\\nof what’s required from self-service? More data often means more questions, which\\nrequires more data. Y ou’ll need to anticipate the growing needs of your self-service\\nusers. Y ou also need to understand the fine balance between flexibility and guardrails\\nthat will help your audience find value and insights without incorrect results and\\nconfusion.\\nData Definitions and Logic\\nAs we’ve emphatically discussed, the utility of data in an organization is ultimately\\nderived from its correctness and trustworthiness. Critically, the correctness of data\\ngoes beyond faithful reproduction of event values from source systems. Data correct‐\\nness also encompasses proper data definitions and logic; these must be baked into\\ndata through all lifecycle stages, from source systems to data pipelines to BI tools and\\nmuch more.\\nData definition refers to the meaning of data as it is understood throughout the orga‐\\nnization.

When the definition of a customer varies, these must be documented\\nand made available to everyone who uses the data.\\nData logic  stipulates formulas for deriving metrics from data—say, gross sales or\\ncustomer lifetime value. Proper data logic must encode data definitions and details\\nof statistical calculations. To compute customer churn metrics, we would need a\\ndefinition: who is a customer? To calculate net profits, we would need a set of logical\\nrules to determine which expenses to deduct from gross revenue.\\nFrequently, we see data definitions and logic taken for granted, often passed around\\nthe organization in the form of institutional knowledge. Institutional knowledge takes\\non a life of its own, often at the expense of anecdotes replacing data-driven insights,\\ndecisions, and actions. Instead, formally declaring data definitions and logic both in a\\ndata catalog and within the systems of the data engineering lifecycle goes a long way\\nto ensuring data correctness, consistency, and trustworthiness.\\nData definitions can be served in many ways, sometimes explicitly, but mostly implic‐\\nitly. By implicit, we mean that anytime you serve data for a query, a dashboard, or\\nan ML model, the data and derived metrics are presented consistently and correctly.\\nWhen you write a SQL query, you’re implicitly assuming that the inputs to this query\\nare correct, including upstream pipeline logic and definitions. This is where data\\nmodeling (described in Chapter 8) is incredibly useful to capture data definitions and\\nlogic in a way that’s understandable and usable by multiple end users.\\nUsing a semantic layer, you consolidate business definitions and logic in a reusable\\nfashion. Write once, use anywhere. This paradigm is an object-oriented approach\\nto metrics, calculations, and logic. We’ll have more to say in “Semantic and Metrics\\nLayers” on page 355.\\nData Mesh\\nData mesh will increasingly be a consideration when serving data. Data mesh funda‐\\nmentally changes the way data is served within an organization. Instead of siloed data\\nteams serving their internal constituents, every domain team takes on two aspects of\\ndecentralized, peer-to-peer data serving.\\nFirst, teams are responsible for serving data to other teams  by preparing it for con‐\\nsumption. Data must be good for use in data apps, dashboards, analytics, and BI\\ntools across the organization. Second, each team potentially runs its dashboards and\\nanalytics for self-service. Teams consume data from across the organization based\\non the particular needs in their domain. Data consumed from other teams may\\nalso make its way into the software designed by a domain team through embedded\\nanalytics or an ML feature.\\nGeneral Considerations for Serving Data | 343'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 368, 'page_label': '343'}, page_content='This dramatically changes the details and structure of serving. We introduced the\\nconcept of a data mesh in Chapter 3. Now that we’ve covered some general considera‐\\ntions for serving data, let’s look at the first major area: analytics.\\nAnalytics\\nThe first data-serving use case you’ll likely encounter is analytics, which is discover‐\\ning, exploring, identifying, and making visible key insights and patterns within data.\\nAnalytics has many aspects. As a practice, analytics is carried out using statistical\\nmethods, reporting, BI tools, and more. As a data engineer, knowing the various\\ntypes and techniques of analytics is key to accomplishing your work. This section\\naims to show how you’ll serve data for analytics and presents some points to think\\nabout to help your analysts succeed.\\nBefore you even serve data for analytics, the first thing you need to do (which should\\nsound familiar after reading the preceding section) is identify the end use case. Is\\nthe user looking at historical trends? Should users be immediately and automatically\\nnotified of an anomaly, such as a fraud alert? Is someone consuming a real-time\\ndashboard on a mobile application? These examples highlight the differences between\\nbusiness analytics (usually BI), operational analytics, and embedded analytics. Each\\nof these analytics categories has different goals and unique serving requirements. Let’s\\nlook at how you’ll serve data for these types of analytics.\\nBusiness Analytics\\nBusiness analytics uses historical and current data to make strategic and actionable\\ndecisions. The types of decisions tend to factor in longer-term trends and often\\ninvolve a mix of statistical and trend analysis, alongside domain expertise and human\\njudgment. Business analysis is as much an art as it is a science.\\nBusiness analytics typically falls into a few big areas—dashboards, reports, and ad hoc\\nanalysis. A business analyst might focus on one or all of these categories. Let’s quickly\\nlook at the differences between these practices and related tools. Understanding an\\nanalyst’s workflow will help you, the data engineer, understand how to serve data.\\nA dashboard concisely shows decision makers how an organization is performing\\nagainst a handful of core metrics, such as sales and customer retention. These core\\nmetrics are presented as visualizations (e.g., charts or heatmaps), summary statistics,\\nor even a single number. This is similar to a car dashboard, which gives you a\\nsingle readout of the critical things you need to know while driving a vehicle. An\\norganization may have more than one dashboard, with C-level executives using\\nan overarching dashboard and their direct reports using dashboards with their par‐\\nticular metrics, KPIs, or objectives and key results (OKRs). Analysts help create\\nand maintain these dashboards.

Currently, you might use BI\\nplatforms to create dashboards, such as Tableau, Looker, Sisense, Power BI, or Apache\\nSuperset/Preset.\\nAnalysts are often tasked by business stakeholders with creating a report. The goal\\nof a report is to use data to drive insights and action. An analyst working at an\\nonline retail company is asked to investigate which factors are driving a higher-than-\\nexpected rate of returns for women’s running shorts. The analyst runs some SQL\\nqueries in the data warehouse, aggregates the return codes that customers provide\\nas the reason for their return, and discovers that the fabric in the running shorts\\nis of inferior quality, often wearing out within a few uses. Stakeholders such as\\nmanufacturing and quality control are notified of these findings. Furthermore, the\\nfindings are summarized in a report and distributed in the same BI tool where the\\ndashboard resides.\\nThe analyst was asked to dig into a potential issue and come back with insights. This\\nrepresents an example of ad hoc analysis . Reports typically start as ad hoc requests.\\nIf the results of the ad hoc analysis are impactful, they often end up in a report\\nor dashboard. The technologies used for reports and ad hoc analysis are similar to\\ndashboards but may include Excel, Python, R-based notebooks, SQL queries, and\\nmuch more.\\nGood analysts constantly engage with the business and dive into the data to answer\\nquestions and uncover hidden and counterintuitive trends and insights. They also\\nwork with data engineers to provide feedback on data quality, reliability issues,\\nand requests for new datasets. The data engineer is responsible for addressing this\\nfeedback and providing new datasets for the analyst to use.\\nReturning to the running shorts example, suppose that after communicating their\\nfindings, analysts learn that manufacturing can provide them with various supply-\\nchain details regarding the materials used in the running shorts. Data engineers\\nundertake a project to ingest this data into the data warehouse. Once the supply-\\nchain data is present, analysts can correlate specific garment serial numbers with the\\nsupplier of the fabric used in the item. They discover that most failures are tied to one\\nof their three suppliers, and the factory stops using fabric from this supplier.\\nThe data for business analytics is frequently served in batch mode from a data\\nwarehouse or a data lake. This varies wildly across companies, departments, and\\neven data teams within companies. New data might be available every second, every\\nminute, every 30 minutes, every day, or once a week. The frequency of the batches\\ncan vary for several reasons. One key thing to note is that engineers working on ana‐\\nlytics problems should consider various potential applications of data—current and\\nfuture.

This is advantageous because\\nyou can take full advantage of your OLAP database’s power. As we’ve discussed in\\nearlier chapters, the downside is cost, access control, and latency.\\nOperational Analytics\\nIf business analytics is about using data to discover actionable insights, then opera‐\\ntional analytics uses data to take immediate action:\\nOperational analytics versus business analytics =\\nimmediate action versus actionable insights\\nThe big difference between operational and business analytics is time. Data used in\\nbusiness analytics takes a longer view of the question under consideration. Up-to-the-\\nsecond updates are nice to know but won’t materially impact the quality or outcome.\\nOperational analytics is quite the opposite, as real-time updates can be impactful in\\naddressing a problem when it occurs.\\nAn example of operational analytics is real-time application monitoring. Many soft‐\\nware engineering teams want to know how their application is performing; if issues\\narise, they want to be notified immediately. The engineering team might have a\\ndashboard (see, e.g., Figure 9-2) that shows the key metrics such as requests per sec‐\\nond, database I/O, or whatever metrics are important. Certain conditions can trigger\\nscaling events, adding more capacity if servers are overloaded. If certain thresholds\\nare breached, the monitoring system might also send alerts via text message, group\\nchat, and email.\\nBusiness and Operational Analytics\\nThe line between business and operational analytics has begun to blur.

We have placed serving for ML alongside analytics\\nbecause the pipelines and processes are extremely similar. There are many ways to\\nserve data for analytics and ML. Some common ways to serve this data include files,\\ndatabases, query engines, and data sharing. Let’s briefly look at each.\\nFile Exchange\\nFile exchange is ubiquitous in data serving. We process data and generate files to pass\\nto data consumers.\\nKeep in mind that a file might be used for many purposes. A data scientist might\\nload a text file (unstructured data) of customer messages to analyze the sentiments\\nof customer complaints. A business unit might receive invoice data from a partner\\ncompany as a collection of CSVs (structured data), and an analyst must perform\\nsome statistical analysis on these files. Or, a data vendor might provide an online\\nretailer with images of products on a competitor’s website (unstructured data) for\\nautomated classification using computer vision.\\nWays to Serve Data for Analytics and ML | 351'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 376, 'page_label': '351'}, page_content='The way you serve files depends on several factors, such as these:\\n• Use case—business analytics, operational analytics, embedded analytics•\\n• The data consumer’s data-handling processes•\\n• The size and number of individual files in storage•\\n• Who is accessing this file•\\n• Data type—structured, semistructured, or unstructured•\\nThe second bullet point is one of the main considerations. It is often necessary to\\nserve data through files rather than data sharing because the data consumer cannot\\nuse a sharing platform.\\nThe simplest file to serve is something along the lines of emailing a single Excel file.\\nThis is still a common workflow even in an era when files can be collaboratively\\nshared. The problem with emailing files is each recipient gets their version of the file.\\nIf a recipient edits the file, these edits are specific to that user’s file. Deviations among\\nfiles inevitably result. And what happens if you no longer want the recipient to have\\naccess to the file? If the file is emailed, you have very little recourse to retrieve the file.\\nIf you need a coherent, consistent version of a file, we suggest using a collaboration\\nplatform such as Microsoft 365 or Google Docs.\\nOf course, serving single files is hard to scale, and your needs will eventually outgrow\\nsimple cloud file storage. Y ou’ll likely grow into an object storage bucket if you have\\na handful of large files, or a data lake if you have a steady supply of files. Object\\nstorage can store any type of blob file and is especially useful for semistructured or\\nunstructured files.\\nWe’ll note that we generally consider file exchange through object storage (data lake)\\nto land under “data sharing” rather than file exchange since the process can be\\nsignificantly more scalable and streamlined than ad hoc file exchange.\\nDatabases\\nDatabases are a critical layer in serving data for analytics and ML. For this discussion,\\nwe’ll implicitly keep our focus on serving data from OLAP databases (e.g., data\\nwarehouses and data lakes). In the previous chapter, you learned about querying\\ndatabases. Serving data involves querying a database and then consuming those\\nresults for a use case. An analyst or data scientist might query a database by using a\\nSQL editor and export those results to a CSV file for consumption by a downstream\\napplication, or analyze the results in a notebook (described in “Serving Data in\\nNotebooks” on page 356).\\nServing data from a database carries a variety of benefits.

For example, a Tableau\\nserver runs an initial query to pull data from a database and stores it locally. Basic\\nOLAP/BI slicing and dicing (interactive filtering and aggregation) runs directly on\\nthe server from the local data copy. On the other hand, Looker (and similar modern\\nBI systems) relies on a computational model called query pushdown; Looker enco‐\\ndes data processing logic in a specialized language (LookML), combines this with\\ndynamic user input to generate SQL queries, runs these against the source database,\\nand presents the output. (See “Semantic and Metrics Layers” on page 355.) Both\\nTableau and Looker have various configuration options for caching results to reduce\\nthe processing burden for frequently run queries.\\nA data scientist might connect to a database, extract data, and perform feature\\nengineering and selection. This converted dataset is then fed into an ML model; the\\noffline model is trained and produces predictive results.\\nData engineers are quite often tasked with managing the database-serving layer. This\\nincludes management of performance and costs. In databases that separate compute\\nand storage, this is a somewhat more subtle optimization problem than in the days\\nof fixed on-premises infrastructure. For example, it is now possible to spin up a\\nnew Spark cluster or Snowflake warehouse for each analytical or ML workload. It is\\ngenerally recommended to at least split out clusters by major use cases, such as ETL\\nand serving for analytics and data science. Often data teams choose to slice more\\nfinely, assigning one warehouse per major area. This makes it possible for different\\nteams to budget for their query costs under the supervision of a data engineering\\nteam.\\nAlso, recall the three performance considerations that we discussed in “Embedded\\nAnalytics” on page 348. These are data latency, query performance, and concurrency.\\nA system that can ingest directly from a stream can lower data latency. And many\\ndatabase architectures rely on SSD or memory caching to enhance query perfor‐\\nmance and concurrency to serve the challenging use cases inherent in embedded\\nanalytics.\\nIncreasingly, data platforms like Snowflake and Databricks allow analysts and data\\nscientists to operate under a single environment, providing SQL editors and data\\nscience notebooks under one roof. Because compute and storage are separated, the\\nanalysts and data scientists can consume the underlying data in various ways without\\ninterfering with each other.

Two concrete examples are Looker and Data Build Tool (dbt).\\nFor instance, Looker’s LookML allows users to define virtual, complex business logic.\\nReports and dashboards point to specific LookML for computing metrics. Looker\\nallows users to define standard metrics and reference them in many downstream\\nqueries; this is meant to solve the traditional problem of repetition and inconsistency\\nin traditional ETL scripts. Looker uses LookML to generate SQL queries, which are\\npushed down to the database. Results can be persisted in the Looker server or in the\\ndatabase itself for large result sets.\\ndbt allows users to define complex SQL data flows encompassing many queries and\\nstandard definitions of business metrics, much like Looker.

These include (but aren’t limited to) the following:\\n• Data analysts•\\n• Data scientists•\\n• MLOps/ML engineers•\\n• The business—nondata or nontechnical stakeholders, managers, and executives•\\nAs a reminder, the data engineer operates in a support role for these stakeholders\\nand is not necessarily responsible for the end uses of data. For example, a data\\nengineer supplies the data for a report that analysts interpret, but the data engineer\\nisn’t responsible for these interpretations. Instead, the data engineer is responsible for\\nproducing the highest-quality data products possible.\\nA data engineer should be aware of feedback loops between the data engineering\\nlifecycle and the broader use of data once it’s in the hands of stakeholders. Data is\\nrarely static, and the outside world will influence the data that is ingested and served\\nand reingested and re-served.\\nA big consideration for data engineers in the serving stage of the lifecycle is the\\nseparation of duties and concerns. If you’re at an early-stage company, the data\\nengineer may also be an ML engineer or data scientist; this is not sustainable. As the\\ncompany grows, you need to establish a clear division of duties with other data team\\nmembers.\\nAdopting a data mesh dramatically reorganizes team responsibilities, and every\\ndomain team takes on aspects of serving. For a data mesh to be successful, each\\nteam must work effectively on its data-serving responsibilities, and teams must also\\neffectively collaborate to ensure organizational success.\\nUndercurrents\\nThe undercurrents come to finality with serving.

Serving is your final chance to make sure your data is in great shape\\nbefore it gets into the hands of end users.\\nSecurity\\nThe same security principles apply whether sharing data with people or systems. We\\noften see data shared indiscriminately, with little to no access controls or thought as\\nto what the data will be used for. This is a huge mistake that can have catastrophic\\nresults, such as a data breach and the resulting fines, bad press, and lost jobs. Take\\nsecurity seriously, especially in this stage of the lifecycle.

What about an\\nML pipeline or reverse ETL process? These users and destinations all have different\\ndata needs, and access should be provided accordingly. Avoid giving carte blanche\\npermissions to everyone and everything.\\nServing data is often read-only unless a person or process needs to update data in the\\nsystem from which it is queried. People should be given read-only access to specific\\ndatabases and datasets unless their role requires something more advanced like write\\nor update access. This can be accomplished by combining groups of users with\\ncertain IAM roles (i.e., analysts group, data scientist group) or custom IAM roles if\\nthis makes sense. For systems, provide service accounts and roles in a similar fashion.\\nFor both users and systems, narrow access to a dataset’s fields, rows, columns, and\\ncells if this is warranted. Access controls should be as fine-grained as possible and\\nrevoked when access is no longer required.\\nAccess controls are critical when serving data in a multitenant environment. Make\\nsure users can access only their data and nothing more. A good approach is to\\nmediate access through filtered views, thus alleviating the security risks inherent in\\nsharing access to a common table. Another suggestion is to use data sharing in your\\nworkflows, which allows for read-only granular controls between you and people\\nconsuming your data.\\nCheck how often data products are used and whether it makes sense to stop sharing\\ncertain data products.

Fine-grained, robust access control means that more interesting data\\nanalytics and ML can be done while still protecting the business and its customers.\\nData Management\\nY ou’ve been incorporating data management along the data engineering lifecycle,\\nand the impact of your efforts will soon become apparent as people use your data\\nproducts. At the serving stage, you’re mainly concerned with ensuring that people can\\naccess high-quality and trustworthy data.\\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, trust is perhaps the most critical\\nvariable in data serving. If people trust their data, they will use it; untrusted data\\nwill go unused. Be sure to make data trust and data improvement an active process\\nby providing feedback loops. As users interact with data, they can report problems\\nand request improvements. Actively communicate back to your users as changes are\\nmade.\\nWhat data do people need to do their jobs? Especially with regulatory and compli‐\\nance concerns weighing on data teams, giving people access to the raw data—even\\nwith limited fields and rows—poses a problem of tracing data back to an entity, such\\nas a person or a group of people. Thankfully, advancements in data obfuscation allow\\nyou to serve synthetic, scrambled, or anonymized data to end users. These “fake”\\ndatasets should sufficiently allow an analyst or data scientist to get the necessary\\nsignal from the data, but in a way that makes identifying protected information\\ndifficult. Though this isn’t a perfect process—with enough effort, many datasets can\\nbe de-anonymized or reverse-engineered—it at least reduces the risk of data leakage.\\nAlso, incorporate semantic and metrics layers into your serving layer, alongside\\nrigorous data modeling that properly expresses business logic and definitions. This\\nprovides a single source of truth, whether for analytics, ML, reverse ETL, or other\\nserving uses.\\nDataOps\\nThe steps you take in data management—data quality, governance, and security—are\\nmonitored in DataOps.

Security is vital to the practice of data engineering.\\nThis should be blindingly obvious, but we’re constantly amazed at how often data\\nengineers view security as an afterthought. We believe that security is the first thing a\\ndata engineer needs to think about in every aspect of their job and every stage of the\\ndata engineering lifecycle. Y ou deal with sensitive data, information, and access daily.\\nY our organization, customers, and business partners expect these valuable assets to\\nbe handled with the utmost care and concern. One security breach or a data leak can\\nleave your business dead in the water; your career and reputation are ruined if it’s\\nyour fault.\\nSecurity is a key ingredient for privacy. Privacy has long been critical to trust in the\\ncorporate information technology space; engineers directly or indirectly handle data\\nrelated to people’s private lives. This includes financial information, data on private\\ncommunications (emails, texts, phone calls), medical history, educational records,\\nand job history. A company that leaked this information or misused it could find\\nitself a pariah when the breach came to light.\\nIncreasingly, privacy is a matter of significant legal importance. For example, the\\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) went into effect in the US in the\\n1970s; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) followed in\\nthe 1990s; GDPR was passed in Europe in the mid-2010s. Several US-based privacy\\nbills have passed or will soon. This is just a tiny sampling of privacy-related statutes\\n(and we believe just the beginning). Still, the penalties for violation of any of these\\nlaws can be significant, even devastating, to a business.

When deciding on security strategies, ensure that\\nyour approach delivers proper security and not just the illusion of safety.\\nAlways Be Paranoid\\nAlways exercise caution when someone asks you for your credentials. When in\\ndoubt—and you should always be in extreme doubt when asked for credentials—\\nhold off and get second opinions from your coworkers and friends.

This is security theater,\\nwhere security is done in the letter of compliance (SOC-2, ISO 27001, and related)\\nwithout real commitment.\\nInstead, pursue the spirit of genuine and habitual security; bake a security mindset\\ninto your culture. Security doesn’t need to be complicated. For example, at our\\ncompany, we run security training and policy review at least once a month to ingrain\\nthis into our team’s DNA and update each other on security practices we can improve.\\nSecurity must not be an afterthought for your data team.

It will do little to protect you in the event of a\\nhuman security breach that grants access to credentials. Encryption is a baseline\\nrequirement for any organization that respects security and privacy. It will protect\\nyou from basic attacks, such as network traffic interception.\\nLet’s look separately at encryption at rest and in transit.\\nEncryption at rest\\nBe sure your data is encrypted when it is at rest (on a storage device). Y our company\\nlaptops should have full-disk encryption enabled to protect data if a device is stolen.\\nImplement server-side encryption for all data stored in servers, filesystems, databases,\\nand object storage in the cloud. All data backups for archival purposes should also be\\nencrypted. Finally, incorporate application-level encryption where applicable.\\nEncryption over the wire\\nEncryption over the wire is now the default for current protocols. For instance,\\nHTTPS is generally required for modern cloud APIs. Data engineers should always\\nbe aware of how keys are handled; bad key handling is a significant source of data\\nleaks. In addition, HTTPS does nothing to protect data if bucket permissions are left\\nopen to the public, another cause of several data scandals over the last decade.\\nEngineers should also be aware of the security limitations of older protocols. For\\nexample, FTP is simply not secure on a public network. While this may not appear\\nto be a problem when data is already public, FTP is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle\\nattacks, whereby an attacker intercepts downloaded data and changes it before it\\narrives at the client. It is best to simply avoid FTP .\\nMake sure everything is encrypted over the wire, even with legacy protocols. When in\\ndoubt, use robust technology with encryption baked in.\\nLogging, Monitoring, and Alerting\\nHackers and bad actors typically don’t announce that they’re infiltrating your systems.\\nMost companies don’t find out about security incidents until well after the fact. Part\\nof DataOps is to observe, detect, and alert on incidents.

Set\\nup budget alerts to make sure your spending is within expectations. If an unex‐\\npected spike occurs in your billing, this might indicate someone or something is\\nutilizing your resources for malicious purposes.\\nExcess permissions\\nIncreasingly, vendors are providing tools that monitor for permissions that are\\nnot utilized by a user or service account over some time. These tools can often be\\nconfigured to automatically alert an administrator or remove permissions after a\\nspecified elapsed time.\\nFor example, suppose that a particular analyst hasn’t accessed Redshift for six\\nmonths. These permissions can be removed, closing a potential security hole.\\nIf the analyst needs to access Redshift in the future, they can put in a ticket to\\nrestore permissions.\\nIt’s best to combine these areas in your monitoring to get a cross-sectional view\\nof your resource, access, and billing profile.

Object storage in the\\ncloud will grow in importance as a batch interface layer between various data services.\\nNew generation file formats (such as Parquet and Avro) are already taking over\\nfor the purposes of cloud data interchange, significantly improving on the dreadful\\ninteroperability of CSV and the poor performance of raw JSON.\\nAnother critical ingredient of a data API ecosystem is a metadata catalog that\\ndescribes schemas and data hierarchies.

This will allow engineers to\\ncode a pipeline and then pass it to the orchestration platform to automatically build,\\ntest, deploy, and monitor.

The rise of ELT,\\ncloud data warehouses, and the abstraction of SaaS data pipelines certainly changed\\nthe game for many companies, opening up new powers for BI, analytics, and data\\nscience.\\nHaving said that, the MDS is basically a repackaging of old data warehouse practices\\nusing modern cloud and SaaS technologies; because the MDS is built around the\\ncloud data warehouse paradigm, it has some serious limitations when compared\\nto the potential of next-generation real-time data applications.

Why look at a report to determine whether to take action when you can\\ninstead automate the action based on events as they occur?\\nAnd it goes much further than this.

Still, they need to understand details of serialization\\nand deserialization formats. As we mentioned in Chapter 6 about storage raw ingre‐\\ndients, serialization and compression algorithms go hand in hand.\\nSerialization Formats\\nMany serialization algorithms and formats are available to data engineers. While the\\nabundance of options is a significant source of pain in data engineering, they are\\nalso a massive opportunity for performance improvements. We’ve sometimes seen\\njob performance improve by a factor of 100 simply by switching from CSV to Parquet\\nserialization. As data moves through a pipeline, engineers will also manage reseriali‐\\nzation—conversion from one format to another.

Data is encoded as\\ncomplete relations (CSV) or documents (XML and JSON), and these are written into\\nfiles sequentially.\\nWith columnar serialization, data organization is essentially pivoted by storing each\\ncolumn into its own set of files. One obvious advantage to columnar storage is that it\\nallows us to read data from only a subset of fields rather than having to read full rows\\nat once. This is a common scenario in analytics applications and can dramatically\\nreduce the amount of data that must be scanned to execute a query.\\nStoring data as columns also puts similar values next to each other, allowing us\\nto encode columnar data efficiently. One common technique involves looking for\\nrepeated values and tokenizing these, a simple but highly efficient compression\\nmethod for columns with large numbers of repeats.\\nEven when columns don’t contain large numbers of repeated values, they may mani‐\\nfest high redundancy.

We cannot\\neasily access individual data records; we must reconstruct records by reading data\\nfrom several column files. Record updates are also challenging. To change one field\\nin one record, we must decompress the column file, modify it, recompress it, and\\nwrite it back to storage. To avoid rewriting full columns on each update, columns\\nare broken into many files, typically using partitioning and clustering strategies that\\norganize data according to query and update patterns for the table.

Generally, densely packed in-memory data\\nstructures were limited to simple types (e.g., INT64) or fixed-width data structures\\n(e.g., fixed-width strings). More complex structures (e.g., JSON documents) could\\nnot be densely stored in memory and required serialization for storage and transfer\\nbetween systems.\\nThe idea of Apache Arrow is to rethink serialization by utilizing a binary data format\\nthat is suitable for both in-memory processing and export. 1 This allows us to avoid\\nthe overhead of serialization and deserialization; we simply use the same format for\\nin-memory processing, export over the network, and long-term storage. Arrow relies\\non columnar storage, where each column essentially gets its own chunks of memory.\\nFor nested data, we use a technique called shredding, which maps each location in the\\nschema of JSON documents into a separate column.\\nThis technique means that we can store a data file on disk, swap it directly into\\nprogram address space by using virtual memory, and begin running a query against\\nthe data without deserialization overhead. In fact, we can swap chunks of the file into\\nmemory as we scan it, and then swap them back out to avoid running out of memory\\nfor large datasets.\\n394 | Appendix A: Serialization and Compression Technical Details'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 419, 'page_label': '394'}, page_content='One obvious headache with this approach is that different programming languages\\nserialize data in different ways. To address this issue, the Arrow Project has created\\nsoftware libraries for a variety of programming languages (including C, Go, Java,\\nJavaScript, MATLAB, Python, R, and Rust) that allow these languages to interoperate\\nwith Arrow data in memory. In some cases, these libraries use an interface between\\nthe chosen language and low-level code in another language (e.g., C) to read and\\nwrite from Arrow. This allows high interoperability between languages without extra\\nserialization overhead. For example, a Scala program can use the Java library to write\\narrow data and then pass it as a message to a Python program.\\nArrow is seeing rapid uptake with a variety of popular frameworks such as Apache\\nSpark. Arrow has also spanned a new data warehouse product; Dremio is a query\\nengine and data warehouse built around Arrow serialization to support fast queries.\\nHybrid Serialization\\nWe use the term hybrid serialization to refer to technologies that combine multiple\\nserialization techniques or integrate serialization with additional abstraction layers,\\nsuch as schema management. We cite as examples Apache Hudi and Apache Iceberg.\\nHudi\\nHudi stands for Hadoop Update Delete Incremental. This table management technol‐\\nogy combines multiple serialization techniques to allow columnar database perfor‐\\nmance for analytics queries while also supporting atomic, transactional updates. A\\ntypical Hudi application is a table that is updated from a CDC stream from a transac‐\\ntional application database. The stream is captured into a row-oriented serialization\\nformat, while the bulk of the table is retained in a columnar format. A query runs\\nover both columnar and row-oriented files to return results for the current state of\\nthe table. Periodically, a repacking process runs that combines the row and columnar\\nfiles into updated columnar files to maximize query efficiency.\\nIceberg\\nLike Hudi, Iceberg is a table management technology. Iceberg can track all files that\\nmake up a table. It can also track files in each table snapshot over time, allowing table\\ntime travel in a data lake environment. Iceberg supports schema evolution and can\\nreadily manage tables at a petabyte scale.\\nDatabase Storage Engines\\nTo round out the discussion of serialization, we briefly discuss database storage\\nengines.

Running some quick analytics on the text, you could identify the words that\\noccur most frequently and create shortened tokens for these words. To compress, you\\nwould replace common words with their tokens; to decompress, you would replace\\nthe tokens with their respective words.\\nPerhaps we could use this naive technique to realize a compression ratio of 2:1 or\\nmore. Compression algorithms utilize more sophisticated mathematical techniques to\\nidentify and remove redundancy; they can often realize compression ratios of 10:1 on\\ntext data.\\nNote that we’re talking about lossless compression algorithms . Decompressing data\\nencoded with a lossless algorithm recovers a bit-for-bit exact copy of the original\\ndata.

the Authors\\nJoe Reis  is a business-minded data nerd who’s worked in the data industry for 20\\nyears, with responsibilities ranging from statistical modeling, forecasting, machine\\nlearning, data engineering, data architecture, and almost everything else in between.\\nJoe is the CEO and cofounder of Ternary Data, a data engineering and architecture\\nconsulting firm based in Salt Lake City, Utah. In addition, he volunteers with several\\ntechnology groups and teaches at the University of Utah. In his spare time, Joe likes\\nto rock climb, produce electronic music, and take his kids on crazy adventures.\\nMatt Housley is a data engineering consultant and cloud specialist. After some early\\nprogramming experience with Logo, Basic, and 6502 assembly, he completed a PhD\\nin mathematics at the University of Utah. Matt then began working in data science,\\neventually specializing in cloud-based data engineering. He cofounded Ternary Data\\nwith Joe Reis, where he leverages his teaching experience to train future data engi‐\\nneers and advise teams on robust data architecture. Matt and Joe also pontificate on\\nall things data on The Monday Morning Data Chat.\\nColophon\\nThe animal on the cover of Fundamentals of Data Engineering  is the white-eared\\npuffbird (Nystalus chacuru).\\nSo named for the conspicuous patch of white at their ears, as well as for their fluffy\\nplumage, these small, rotund birds are found across a wide swath of central South\\nAmerica, where they inhabit forest edges and savanna.\\nWhite-eared puffbirds are sit-and-wait hunters, perching in open spaces for long\\nperiods and feeding opportunistically on insects, lizards, and even small mammals\\nthat happen to come near. They are most often found alone or in pairs and are\\nrelatively quiet birds, vocalizing only rarely.\\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the white-eared\\npuffbird as being of least concern, due, in part, to their extensive range and stable\\npopulation. Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are\\nimportant to the world.\\nThe cover illustration is by Karen Montgomery, based on an antique line engraving\\nfrom Shaw’s General Zoology . The cover fonts are Gilroy Semibold and Guardian\\nSans. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Con‐\\ndensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Antenna House PDF Output Library 7.1.1639', 'creator': 'AH CSS Formatter V7.1 MR2 for Linux64 : 7.1.3.50324 (2021-04-26T09:47+09)(Jisupdf Editor)', 'creationdate': '2022-06-22T13:50:38+00:00', 'author': 'Reis, Joe;Housley, Matt;', 'ebx_publisher': \"O'Reilly Media, Incorporated\", 'icnappname': 'Jisupdf Editor', 'icnappplatform': 'Windows', 'icnappversion': '2.03', 'moddate': 'D:20240420165355', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering', 'source': 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering (Reis, JoeHousley, Matt) (Z-Library).pdf', 'total_pages': 445, 'page': 444, 'page_label': '419'}, page_content='Learn from experts.  \\nBecome one yourself.\\nBooks | Live online courses   \\nInstant Answers | Virtual events \\nVideos | Interactive learning\\nGet started at oreilly.com. \\n©2022 O’Reilly Media, Inc.
